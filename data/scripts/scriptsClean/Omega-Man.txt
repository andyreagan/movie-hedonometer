Warner Bros. Studios a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut.

He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. so that As the passenger space of the car, we "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and to as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a sten gun in his right hand, fires directly - from to of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses.

Repeat This is a... - As the there are, here and there, a few bodies in the hallways, the beds are full. - - Neville sits at his desk in white lab coat, sign on desk says He is watching a small on his desk. so now the question is survival. Is this the end of technological man? Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of science, the superhuman conquests of space and time... the age of the wheel? Neville grimaces, shakes his head. At the end of next speech We were warned of judgment. Well, It's come now. This is the Judgement, the weeping and gnashing of teeth... Oh, God, where will it end...? - nodding, face set. Yes. Soits airborne bacteria. Let's try-vaccine 93-b-71. How the hell do know? don't... It might.

In right side of frame, teacher's desk with small flag, rotten apple. Again, of Neville passes outside. - As he rounds corner, he sees things lying scattered in the street ahead. He tries to stop, but runs over them. - - He is irritated, looks around as if seeking a filling station attendant in order to get tire fixed. Glances down. He has run over a broken steel box, with Mint markings. Its torn hinges have shredded the tire, and the gold ingots it contained are scattered under the wheels. He glances across street. Brink's truck sits crashed into a fire hydrant, its rear doors open, swinging useless in breeze. Mint boxes and gold bullion lying unguarded. - His expression is one of total disgust. He speaks sardonically. Why don't they keep the goddamn street clean. - He unloads car, hangs gun over his back, puts a few grenades in his belt, lifts gas can. As he walks away from car, he muses. There was a Mercedes agency on Sunset. Or was it Wilshire? - Ahead is the agency. Windows are broken. convertible sits in the showroom. Neville walks through the broken window, walks around car. The color's not right, but ... how long did you say it takes to get a new one from Germany...? He walks to another car. How about this one? One careful Pasadena driver in tennis shoes? What's her phone number? - He has put in battery, gas, etc. He closes hood, gets in. Glances at watch. My God, is it that late? He guns the motor and drives out through the broken window. . - We see Neville speeding down an empty main thoroughfare, the car accelerating faster and faster. He makes an impossible turn, the car bottoming, righting itself, fishtailing, straightening out and zooming on. - long which shows the car reaching speeds of over a hundred miles an hour. - This is Nevilles concentration, his tension must show. He looks like a master-driver in the ultimate test of his career. Meanwhile, it is getting darker, closer to night. - as to of the car careening down a deserted street in absolute recklessness. As Neville nears the end of the street, he slightly sideswipes a car parked out from the curb. - Tires squeal as Neville turns corner. as car rights itself and shoots away. - The car lights are on now, and as Neville slows down, it is deep twilight. He turns into drive in front of a tall apartment building. of Neville in car. He presses remote-control button and garage door open ahead of him. to Neville's face. He shows relief, as if he has made, It through a very tough race indeed. - As Neville guns motor and starts into garage, a figure detaches itself from growing darkness and leaps onto him. The figure seems simply to materialize) and it leaps high, landing almost in the car. Neville tries to fight back as the car drifts down the drive into garage. - from within the garage. the car drifting down the ramp into garage, Neville and the black-clad figure wrestle as the car, at low speed, crashes into a pillar or another car. Neville pushes the black figure away, hits him, hits him again, jumps from the car with his sten gun and fires a burst into the black figure. as he turns from the fallen figure. He looks outward at the still-open garage door, his face reflecting fear, horror. - Two more black-clad figures are rushing in armed with clubs or spears. - as Neville fires his sten gun directly into Above the gun, his face is clenched in hatred, loathing. - The door is lowering now. There is a body lying in a dark heap-just inside. can one or two others scurrying away outside in the dark as the door closes4 - He has lowered his gun, holds the remote-control box, pressing the button to lower the door. He is exhausted, shoulders slumped. He walks through the garage stopping to check a large gasoline-powered generator that has been jury-rigged to a panel to distribute current. There are shelves full of oil and batteries and similar supplies. He walks through the low-lighted garage. There are several rows of bright automobiles, sports cars, jeeps, a few pick-up trucks, a single armored car. All are kept in good condition, brightly polished. Neville walks back out into the open area of the garage, surveying the damage to the Mercedes, shaking his head. That's a shame. So hard to get a repairman these days, too. - Neville unlocks an elevator, gets in and pushes the button for the top floor. Penthouse, Robert. He's probably anxious to get on with the game. He leans back against the side of the elevator, eyes closed, exhausted, but still on the verge of laughter. Some game... - - The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming into his fortress-apartment. In left of is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops sten gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure. Okay, Okay, Im ready. in middle to on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. Go ahead ... move. Neville walks into what seems another world, as to It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder. Why dont you have a belt? It might improve your game. He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. at to Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on. But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill... showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Nevilles loneliness and isolation tell on him. - He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch. You hear all that downstairs? let sundown catch me out. So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. was lucky... Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. moves to showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment) From time to time he gets nervous. He smells the end game coming... Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. so as to place chessboard once more in middle Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set. But end games are fall of surprises, arent they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check! He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down. - - We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we It is Frankie Laine singing "We'll Be Together Again." No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again... Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental "Harlem Nocturne," Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo. Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise to of his His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the Come out, Neville Neville sighs, smiles at bust. Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment. He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we a fire start up, blaze higher. - They're at It again. Burning, wrecking. wonder what tonight? library? laboratory? Maybe they've found the Museum of Fine Art. Goddamn those crazy bastards... - He raises the rifle. - weird and unreal area outside range of floodlights. Passes a hunched, squatting figure. Stops, moves back Crosshairs glow as sight is given fine adjustment. as we Figure slumps. - is across chessboard, through pieces from busts Neville is grinning sardonically. He raises the rifle in salute. Hall Caesar! And what do you suppose Brother Matthias is going to say about that? - is from outside window. farther and farther until we Neville's penthouse, a circle of brilliant light in an ocean of surrounding darkened buildings, no street lights. when penthouse is only a small glimmer of light. (Matte) - Fire flickers as to reveal that it Is made 'up of burning books. titles: Molecular Biology, Astrophysics, etc. In we see many members of the Family systematically wrecking scientific and computer equipment. Three? You're sure? Not three. Three, Brother. Two were inside the garage when he brought down the door, We heard the shooting. Then Joshua... bringing Matthias head and shoulders. Matthias has dead-white hair, complexion, wears enormous sunglasses with reflecting lenses. The light, you have to stay clear of the light... revealing Zachary. He Is like Matthias, white with sunglasses. But his hair Is natural and his features clearly African. Zachary speaks defensively. Brother, there wasn't no light... That cat hit Joshua in pitch black... He cant see in the dark-...anymore than we can In the light. Zachary shrugs. Go tell him. Brother. He sees good enough, dark or light. Matthias walks in the glare of flames, wrecking continues In His dialogue is delivered sadly, reasonably at first. one creature... caught in a place he can't stir from in the dark. One lone man... He aint a man, Brother. No, no, you're right. But he is alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, with nothing to live for but memories ...nothing to live with but his gimmicks and gadgetry, his guns and ears...and yet the whole Family cant bring him down out of that...that... Pig-paradise, Brother? - Matthias smiles sadly. Forget the old ways, Brother, the old hatreds, the old pains. The Family is one... Zachary nods, matching Matthias grin. Hog heaven, then... But Matthias is getting worked up. Its not a joke, Brother. Remember the word! That thing, that Neville, is a creature of the wheel! He uses forbidden weapons, to6.ls! He has the power of Hell In those evil things! - He is agitated, tired of hearing this. He has told them before that he can bring Neville down. He tries again. Well, let me put the power on him. Look... his pointing finger. In a glass-fronted refrigeration unit are flasks of nitroglycerin. to ...or there's cannons. can go to the old Guard armory. could get a rocket-launcher ... Just turn me loose... - - We that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads. Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child. Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that. Any one of us could. But if we did, The curse would begin once more, don't you see that? - Zachary is sullen. see that bastard living In the light like God whilst we rot and hide down here like grubs ... What do you reckon will happen if he hunts as out while We sleep? Put it out of mind, Brother. He will be destroyed. But not by guns and explosives. They are forbidden. They are never to be used again. When we have cleansed the word the flood of our righteousness will sweep it all away... As Matthias speaks he picks up a book and hurls it toward the fire, knocking elaborate glass structure down. And Neville will be brought down... down to the Family and judgment. For blasphemy, for murder... As he speaks from fire, grown larger now, engulfing whole building behind, to brightly lit top story of Neville's apartment.' - The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We at first but Then we the of someone finds a should be made sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure. - He is in sweat suit, the shirt has in large letters on front, his sten gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard. ...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville. He squats, pulls map from pouch, studies it, speaks into small tape-mike. down from building This is 6306 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. The last six blocks have been clean. In the 5500 block, some signs they'd been foraging for food in a small drive-in grocery. (sardonically) You'd think prices would keep them in the super markets. - He unlimbers sten gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder. You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now. Drinks again, lets mike-hang, eyes distant in thoughts If could find the nest, find where he stays thered be an end-run, and an end game, sure enough... He gets up, closes canteen, picks up equipment. But what would do then...? - He moves through dark corridors, into rooms. He is very efficient in his checking, spending only a few moments in each place. - Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. is Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, sten gun ready. - The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous. - He is sickened, his raised adrenaline draining away. - He probes in comers, closets. Obviously is well practiced at this "search and destroy" technique. . - He is moving. rapidly through offices, dust everywhere, files, etc. scattered. He always checks closets, etc. - His eyes narrow, he leans over and reaches down into wastebasket. - - - He lifts up a sardine can, oil drips from it. Neville smiles viciously. - In it are empty bottles, trash. It is not dusty or old looking. - Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open. - - It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Nevilles response. toward figure. now in Neville's as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. on figure in chair, it stirs. All right, Dracula. Wake up. You've got company. Figure does not move. of sten gun poked toward him from We cannot see eyes of figure. Where's Matthias? Where does he stay? Figure does not move. - He shrugs, sighs. always ask, and always get the same answer (beat) Once more: where's the hive? Where does the king bee stay? - As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. We Neville's into tape recorder. 6806 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. Found another. Matthias' crowd is dying from the plague, one by one. Sweep continues. - He walks, one hand in pocket, a sten gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor. You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? Youre the only consumer left in town. - He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back. The Officers club is closed, isn't it? Permanent undress is the correct uniform. - Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. is - - Again of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his sten gun is in his right hand. - is from between the upraised arms of a manikin. - - - He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence. - This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles. - This is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands. It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen. - - He is still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there Is a small indefinite He pauses, his jaw tightens. as Neville whirls, sten gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire. - These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. the "manikins" mouth open In horror. - - Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes Into the shadows of the store. - He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand. He stands thus for's long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her. Wait...come back...wait... Youre real! Youre not... - Again, this is through a group of male manikins, well dressed, grinning at Neville as he runs. - - He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store. This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. still focussed on Neville. When the is by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her. - In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon. - He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity. Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much? Then his head comes up. He has control again. No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home. He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed. - showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, sten gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as for of Neville In of - He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he a from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound. - Sign reads "Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime" - He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle. - - This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. is from wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine - - His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks. Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we another at back. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches. - We a who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar. - From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. from near floor level to five feet or so, following of Family member. - From behind Neville. As he approaches rack, the entire Rack tilts and slowly falls toward him. - throws himself back, trying to avoid the rack, but as he does so, he looks up. - - hood flaring behind, arms outstretched - - bottles falling out of rack and exploding on floor. Creature jumps free from top of rack, - Three more of the creatures pile-out from behind barrels, wine racks, wherever they've been sleeping. Shook as for very dead white face, Its mouth open, twisted with hatred and anger, eyes still obscured by hood. As light begins to fill the again, without as from a great distance, in sound, the of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As he goes on, his voice moves toward ...and, oh, brothers and sisters, ask you to look at him. Does he have the Marks? Do you see them? (muffled answers of "no, no.") You see him as we were before the Punishment, before we gained grace. You see lying there, the last of scientists and bankers and business- men...the users of the wheel! Do we use the tools of the wheel, as he does? ("no, not.") Is he of The Family? ("no, not") Is he of the Sacred Society? (no, not.") Then ... what is he? (confused mumbling, anger) NEVILLE's the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. - of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low. He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him. - Neville is regaining consciousness. on him as Matthias talks. He is part of the dead...he has no place here. He has the stink of oil and electric circuitry about him. He is obsolete... ( ...yes, yes.") Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields. And what shall we do with old machinery...? - - He points at Neville. ... you are discarded. You are the rubbish of the past... - His initial horror and fear past, he aloud. This is a bloody Halloween party... Youre all sick ... You need... Those nearest, knock him back down, silence him. - He smiles, shakes his head. His voice becomes soft with false compassion. He leans down over his pulpit. How hard it is to admit the truth. (beat) Take him to the little room. For the Questioning... - as they take Neville into a smaller room. - - This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp. Well, now, Mr. Neville, we can talk for a little while. It's been a long time since you've talked -- except to yourself. - Neville is surprised. He has assumed Matthias was truly and completely insane. So you dont rant all the time? Why bother with it at all? - He walks around the dark room. Yes, you were a scientist. The kind of man who understood nothing until there was almost nothing left to understand. (surly) I'm getting along... You're getting dead, Mr. Neville -- or doctor or colonel, whatever they called you. have responsibility for the last tiny remnant of mankind ... have that responsibility. Then why the hell dont you live up to it? Why don't you throw away the costumes and get these people organized, try to work on a cure... Matthias turns on him angrily. Oh. we are organized. You know that well enough. cure? There is none. In the early days ... Have you seen the ruins of the general hospital? Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor? - tried. There was a crash... - It doesn't matter. There was no cure. Is none. The curse you people created, couldn't stop, is... forever. So Ive turned that curse into a blessing. - No. now the Family has found its way. It can bear the burden -- the only curse left is -- you. You are insane. And before very damn long, youll be dead -- can't you see that? - (angrily) last night you killed how many? Three of us? And today We don't know yet. And before that? You've killed dozens...Youre the messenger of death, Doctor, not us. - come the room now, and Matthias manner changes. Once again he adopts the portentous pose of judge-prophet. was defending myself ... You lunatics came after me... He's confessed all, Brothers. Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of proscribed rites. He admits 'science, medicine, weapons, machines, electricity. He has not shared the Punishment; he does not bear the Marks... - What is the Punishment? The Marks? - As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city. - As from one to another, each removes his or her glasses, goggles, etc. revealing blank white eyes. completes pan, stops on Matthias. He removes glasses, shows his own white eyes. For the first time, the of the Family. (quietly) These are the Marks, Mr. Neville ... The Punishment is what you and those like you brought upon us... on Matthias, closes slowly on his face, eyes, as he talks. In the beginning, we tried to help one another, those that were left. We tried to clean things up, set them straight. We buried and burned. And it came to us that we were spared for just that work... - ... to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil, dangerous... Neville's breaks in harsh, angry. So you burned libraries, laboratories...You wrecked computer centers, engineering facilities ... a herd of insane barbarians. Every night you go on burning. He still speaks very quietly. You call us barbarians, Neville'. Very well, it's an honorable name. We mean to cancel the world you made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons began to threaten more than they offered. - You'll play hell... - No, you've played hell you and your dead kinsmen of the car and the plane and the tank and the bomb ... and when you die, the-last living reminder of hell will be gone ... forever. As he speaks, The Family assent. Matthias turns to Zachary. Brother Zachary? We got everything ready. - - An alley or narrow street. There, a cart has been brought. It has high sides and two solid wooden wheels about five feet in diameter. It is filled with old newspapers, books, files, broken pieces of wooden furniture, etc. is made Neville and Matthias. Matthias and Family have glasses or shields back on. Zachary comes over, jerks Neville roughly toward cart. Matthias stops him. One thing, Neville, now that its over... Neville stares back at him. why didn't you leave? Why didn't you get out of the city...? wasnt sure about that ... until now. - On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre. in hood, eyes opaque, insanely, throwing objects at Neville. - trying to reach through the slats of the cart to scratch Neville. They are dead white. - over a wave of candles, the flames flickering Insanely. - filling a narrow street from Neville's who stands tied to the cart, wood and paper and books piled around him. to We find that we are in a In the midst of the field, all carrying candles, are gathered around the stand from which Matthias preaches. The cart has been turned upside-down and the technological debris it contained is piled below one of the wheels, to which Neville Is bound, spread-eagled. It stands in a large circular burned area. This is where Matthias and the Family have burned bodies after the plague's onslaught. - - Here Is evil... past Neville's profile. As Matthias speaks, to Is this not the place where all the dead burned? And this (pointing to Neville) Is the last of the dead...And what will we do with this corpse? As Matthias asks his question and the Family for Nevilles death, as stadium At first flickeringly, then with a of fall power. All the lights do not come on. Some bulbs ate burnt out or have failed over the past year or so, but still the field la flooded with light. - falling back from their stand, trying to cover their eyes despite their sunglasses. (surprised) What...? - Family members dropping their candles, falling, groping, trying to find a way out of the blazing arc lights. - writhing on ground in agony. Find the switch, get those lights off...! Give us the darkness again! More dark ... more dark! - stumbling blindly toward sidelines of stadium. - trying to stab Neville, missing him In his blindness. - Neville still staked out in center of stadium. Last of the creatures Is crawling or hobbling away out of the light. After a long moment the are-lights begin to fade, wink, and finally go out. of Neville struggling, trying to get loose. Then he pauses, fear in his expression, He someone - walking swiftly across the empty field, Neville tries to twist his head around to see, but it is too dark down in the bowl of the stadium to see more than a shadowy figure. - - quickly loosening the ropes on Neville's ankles and hands. - Shadow of someone above him. He pulls loose from the last rope. Who are you? Dutch Shut up. Move, move, Neville begins to run, pushed by the shadowy figure. - running to edge of field. - running into ramp area, disappearing under stands. - Figure behind him pushes him along in the darkness, giving him no pause. Matthias and his people are re-grouped, looking for Neville. - Find him. Search the Corridors... the storerooms...everywhere... Figure behind pushes him through a door, slams it closed. Neville falls to his knees, shakes his head, trying to get his bearings. beam of light from an electric torch sitting on a box dimly illuminates the room. He rises, starts to turn. Then, from shadows behind him, between lockers he All right, son of a bitch. Just hold tight... (beat) Uh-uh, dont turn. Stand. When want you turned, Ill turn you. on or off or around. Lisas voice is low, smooth, sophisticated, but there is in It the sound of a profound self-confidence. - - Lisa slowly drifts is on Neville. Lisas head, right shoulder are blurred. Her hand comes up holding a .45 automatic. Neville still In Thats fine. Now put your hands out... way out, shoulder high. Like they were going to crucify you. - looking his head and shoulders in In shadows behind, vaguely, the .45 in from torch. As a matter of fact, they were going to roast me. Why did you stop them? Lisa comes closer. We can She Is beautiful, and black. She Is wearing a shirt, tails tied, and long shorts, with cycle boots. Her face is composed, almost amused as she moves up behind Neville. We've got a reason, Neville's eyebrows rise. He is setting himself to turn on her. My name is Robert... Your name's mud, Mister. Neville whirls, on Lisa who lifts the .45, brings it chopping down with moderate force. - Lisa is breathing a little harder, but her composure is fine. She cooks pistol. Neville is getting off floor staring into muzzle of .45, rubbing his head, looking at the girl with grudging respect. ...and youre not going to need a name if you fool with me again. She nudges Neville toward the door. He raises his hands automatically. They walk. Where did you pick up that cute way of saying stop? still behind, looking from one side to the other as they traverse corridors. Oakland. was a Raider. Anyhow, only said slow. You know how say stop? The pistol nudges Neville's ribs. Neville keeps walking. You keep clowning around, and those spooks out there are going to... Shut up. Dutch is taking care of the honks. - running closer toward the corridor, This shot, we discover, Is from of the shadowy figure, Dutch, who now stands in darkness. Dutch fumbling with something. now on Dutchs hand rises, holding cylindrical container. Matthias' people still in reach corridor entrance. Dutch throws container. - As they try to enter, there is a blinding explosion of only moderate as a phosphorus grenade explodes. should capitalize on diffusion, refraction of phosphorus blow-up, its brilliant blue-white glare. No, no ... get back ... The next entrance... - Neville is in Lisa behind with pistol. They are trotting. okay... stop, Open it up. They are standing near a utility room. Neville turns and sees her for the first time. Youre..! Okay, you've seen me before. Pull it out buster ... move! Neville wheels out a small motorcycle, (admiringly) You plan ahead... We plan every which a way. Now look, you're gonna ran this thing, but I'm the ramrod, you know? Neville says nothing, seating himself on the bike. Do me a favor, will you? Don't screw up. know how to roll, Out It's hard on the elbows ... and oh, yeah, If you just have to play James Bond, I'm gonna sift your brains All over the walls, Neville grins In spite of himself. Yes, ma'am... as he, starts cycle and they move down shadowy corridors. - They tan along corridor, seeking Neville. of bike can be heard - As we see another grenade appear, we Alts laughter from side corridor. Grenade explodes, spurting burning phosphorus onto one of Family. to as Family member in pain. Down the other way. We'll catch them at the main exit ... the ramp. - Lisa yells directions to him as Neville skids bike around corners, in and bat, around obstacles like heaps of cushions, piles of coke cases, etc, Shot should take advantage of bike light, refractions, shadows, veering of bike, near collisions. Left, left, goddamn It. (beat) Another leftand step on it. - Shot is from Dutchs revealing Dutch, standing about ten yards from ramp. He holds a grenade In each hand. It is still dark, but the first signs of pre-dawn are We the roar of the Family as they run inside the corridor toward ramp. As they Dutch lofts the first one and then the other grenade, tossing one on each side of the exit, leaving a narrow passage directly in the middle, free of the phosphorous, though bathed in blinding Matthias and Family fall back in confusion. We sound of bike over their yells, Dutchs laughter. - They skid around final corner. Neville hits brakes, Leaves rubber. - Matthias and his people, turned and blinded by burning phosphorus, Neville coming. to Matthias. He is coming ... There... - What the h6ll you stopped for? Hit It, you dumb honk! You want me to? Lisa prods him with the pistol. Right on, you lump. They're blinded. Right on! Neville shrugs, races engine. Okay, baby, hitch up your drawers... He revs engine, kicks off straight toward Matthias and Family. - We see Matthias and the rest coming closer and closer as of bike becomes deafening Behind Family is burning phosphorus. Matthias Puts out his hands as If to wave Neville to a stop. Stop them, stop them... - - - Shot closer to Family. - - Down the middle, right down he middle! - - As bike flashes through them, some of the Family try to stop Neville. Bike veers, rights, sails through, knocking Family members in all directions, - Neville manages to steer down slot between the two bombs Dutch has thrown. For a moment, the bike and its riders are bathed in weird glow of phosphorus. Howls of disappointed Family can be heard. - They roar down ramp and into empty parking lot. showing Dutch in cranking up his own bike, laughing exultantly at the success of the escape. He watches Neville and Lisa race away, and after another look in the direction of the stadium where the grenades still burn, he follows them. - - - - She has left arm around his middle, gun in right hand aimed into ribs. Yells Into his ear: Take the next exit... As they reach exit, Neville wheels the bike suddenly. Lisa has to grab him with both hands. He plucks gun from her hand, lowers the hammer as they speed down off-ramp. Lisa Yells: You sneaky bastard Neville hands her back the gun. She sticks it into her belt and puts both arms around him at they go off onto country road. - They pull up in front of an apparently deserted house perched on the edge of a canyon. Neville leans the bike on its stand, stretches, turns. - She is holding gun on him again, smiling broadly. - He scratches his head. Well, I'll be damned. thought we'd gotten past that... Youre sweet. Now just walk on up to that house. - is next to door through which they will pass. Window looks dusty, drapes faded, torn. As Lisa and Neville approach door, across barrel of Thompson submachine gun and hands holding it, revealing that is from - It is moderately dark In house. Neville rubs his eyes. is still Neville sees gunman. Lisa moves up beside him. It's all right, Tommy. This is the Man.... mean Man.... but he's tame. - He Is a small Chinese boy of about twelve who holds the machine gun nervously pointed at Neville, He smiles at Lisa, frowns at Neville. What are you gonna do with him, Lisa? - (to Neville) Have you got any idea what Tom would have done If you'd come up to this house carrying my .45? Neville nods. Im beginning to get an idea. as others walk into light. They have been waiting to see what was happening. This is the crop... There are perhaps six or eight young people about evenly divided between boys and girls. The others, except for Lisa and her brother, are white. all there is. At least that we know of. There are others around, guess... If Matthias and his nuts havent killed them all. Neville is astonished. The kids seem healthy, alert. didnt know there were...any. (sardonically) Between Matthias and his goons at night and you In the daytime shooting anything that moved, we stayed low, was staying Alive, The others exchange glances, If you call that living. Neville Is Irked. He did not come for a seminar In ethics. Then there is the of a motorcycle outside, All turn, toward the door, Its Dutch... He runs toward door, Lisa and the rest follow, Neville in rear. He climbs off cycle, drops kickstand. He wears a leather jacket, a air of pearl-handled .45 automatics on his hips. Saddlebags are staffed with grenades, a Thompson submachine gun, etc. Dutch also wears goggles, an old World War style helmet, riding breeches and Jack-boots. His hair is long, and on the back of his jacket is painted the upraised red fist of revolution--with the middle finger extended. He is a tough cookie, but very bright indeed. Tommy and Lisa into picture. Hey, it's the mad bomber. Where you at, baby? Dutch pulls off his helmet, smiles at Lisa, ruffles Tommy's hair. to include others in Dutch looks at Neville. see you got my partner, the mad doctor, here all right. - You know who am? to Dutch knew about you. He knew your work... Neville looks astonished. My work...? Dutch stares upward, hands in back of breeches, reciting from memory. "Biowar Pathology Parameters in Urban and Semi-urban Environment" Journal of Military Medicine, June, 1974, "Incremental Effects Countermeasures to Toxic Agents in Liquid Systems Delivery" Microbiological Letters, January, 1975 God Almighty, Countermeasures to what...? To somebody poisoning your well. Neville grins. Where did you pick up on that? Med school, was a senior when they scratched the whole world. was going to apply to Biowar Labs for a post-doc, but the next term never came. Neville is surprised, touched. I'm sorry you didn't make it. If you all are done with the mutual admiration, you reckon we can go on Into Richie? Richie? They walk toward house. Lisas brother. He looks like hes about to go over. He frowns uncomprehendingly. Go over...? They have reached house now head down hall into darkened bedroom. Oh, that's right. You've only seen the tertiary cases ... Were primary, you see. Neville is stunned. It simply has not occurred to him that the young people are also victims of the plague. When it hit, the older people either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast. You know: blindness in light, albinism, psychotic delusions, occasional stages of torpor: like Matthias and his gang. And you? Some of the younger people had a kind of resistance. We...hold out. One or two of us are a little bit light sensitive, but otherwise all right. But Richie's going. He's advanced secondary. - girl comes out. How is he? (shaking head) No better. The color is gone from his skin, Lisa. Hesalmost white. Lisa shakes her head. If he wasn't out of his head already, thatd really blow his mind. Dutch laughs without humor, lights a candle. They step darkened room, close to bed. They look down to see a lying on bed, tossing. His skin Is light- not dead white, but very light--though his features are African. His hair is natural, but also light His eyes, when he opens them, are white, but only iris is missing. Pupil is still visible. Neville leans down over him, studying him. This is our first chance to see Neville as Doctor. Well...? Shut up. - He goes over Richie carefully, checking vital signs, blood pressure, reflexes, etc. He could hold here for weeks and then come up one of Matthias' monsters--or he could go over in ten minutes. (still examining Richie) So they go through fever and delirium passing from your state to Matthias'? And then, At Matthias, they hold again. Indefinitely. - I've seen them go over before. almost got killed last summer by a friend. He went over without any warning. When looked away. he was kind of pale and: his hair was going. When looked back he didn't have any eyes. - (looking up) What did you do...? Dutch shrugs, looks At Neville steadily. Why doctor, did like you do. killed the son of a bitch. (insistently) Listen, if the Masonic rites are over, how about Richie? Neville rises and they walk Other sit around reading, playing guitar, eating. We'll take him to my place. I've got most of what need there. (scornfully) Is there anything you can do, Doctor? Youve lost 200 million patients already. Neville studies her a moment. don't have it. Have what? Time, a care? don't have the plague. I'm immune. - Even Lisa looks awed. Dutch frowns, confused. Everybody...has it (quietly) Everybody but me. There was a vaccine. Only an experimental batch. We never thought... - They watch Neville expressionless If' you're immune, then your... My blood could be a serum. At this stage the antibodies might turn it around ... stop it... - - Richie is completely covered to keep him from the light. - - Neville and Dutch are talking. ...nothing with drugs. Its got to be the serum. Couldnt you reconstitute the vaccine? tried. Have you got any Idea how many steps it takes to synthesize an antibiotic specific to this bag? Showing Neville one of Matthias creatures, him, him with various drugs. of Nevilles face, the creatures face. As Neville him again, the creature breaks loose, smashes a flask over Nevilles head, toward elevator, falls, clutching throat, dies. (continuing) caught one of. Matthias creatures. used everything on the shelves And...? He goddamned near killed me. And then he died very badly himself. - - So it's... Very tight, doctor. Very tight, Indeed. - They are at garage door unloading Richie carefully. Elevator Reaction of Lisa, Dutch, small girl, others to apartment. They amazed at the art, the beauty of left side. Lisa turns, sees arsenal, lab. see where you do your heavy thinking. - That side keeps this side going. You can't have one without the other. - (sardonically) Like love and marriage...? - (sardonically) Thats the way they used to sing the song. They take Richie down through lab side of apartment. At end is a door, another room there. Bed, etc. The guest room. Lisa looks at dust, cobwebs. You weren't expecting us... Neville pauses in helping put Richie in bed, looks up at Lisa. No, wasn't expectingyou. - We Lisa still in through doorway looking after Richie, youngsters looking everywhere in apartment. Ill need some help. This place spooks the kids. They're used to the country. - Lisa is all the help youll need. You'll make out just fine. They exchange glances. Id almost forgotten how it wasto have people that matter to you. That's all the mattering there is. - As the youngsters climb back into truck, one, a little girl, comes to Neville who stands with Lisa. Dutch stands nearby. She looks up At Neville. - They come at night, the Family; they come in the dark, and some of the kids say theyll take Richies soul and put it in a bag, and give it to the Devil! That's what some of the kids say - Oh, won't let them do that, honey... Maybe... - Are you God? Neville smiles. Lisa cuts in. Let's find out if hes even a doctor before we go promoting him. They laugh as Dutch picks up the child puts her in cab of truck. - The fountain splashes In the Truck in moving away. In on either side of frame in profile are Neville and Lisa looking at one Another. - Neville has a glucose drip set up, and on a table beside the bed various equipment for blood samples, etc. He stands looking down at the boy who mumbles, twists, resting uneasily. Neville picks up a hypo, draws some fluid from a small phial, gives Richie a shot. After a moment or so, his restlessness abates. Lisa comes into room quietly, comes up behind Neville quite close. She is in shadow, only barely visible. How about a break? Well need one. There's nothing more to do until tomorrow... mean for dinner. Neville turns. - - In this shot, we discover for the first time since the very brief encounter in the clothing store that Lisa is an exceptionally beautiful woman. She Is dressed In a white mini-skirt, completely feminine. - Lisa takes Nevilles hand, Pulls him toward other room. In Lisa moves toward phonograph, Neville heads for liquor cabinet. As he passes bust of Caesar and chessboard, he glances down at, board. Your move - She looks up slightly puzzled. What are we playing? - taking gin and sherry down from cabinet. He turns, looks puzzled too. Then he (pointing at bust) My partner. Also my attorney executive officer, chief of staff... Lisa takes cap off bust, perches it on her own head, grins at Neville. You sure know how to pick em. is lush, insinuating The table setting Is expensive china and crystal. In the balcony, drapes parted, moon low in sky. of being filled, to reveal Lisa and Neville sitting at table. He has on a shirt, neckerchief, sports coat. How did you find the dress? Lisa smiles. The same way you found the jacket. hustled it. Neville looks thoughtful. wonder why either of as bothered to pick them up. Lisa finishes a mouthful of food. No bother. The house-fuzz was on extended vacation. Anyhow, you never believe you're the only one left. There was a song: someday my prince will come... Neville grins. Yeah. That was in Show White. Lisa blushes, looks irritated, but goes on. kept thinking, someday something's got to come along ... and that's about what happened. What? Lisa looks him over. (sardonically) Something, - smiles, pours wine, One question... - All right. What? - Those stadium lights... how did you manage that? No power, no gas for the emergency generator, the patching... - looks smug, coy. Oh, Massa Neville, this year chile's gone to college. School of electrical engineeringat Berkeley. Neville rolls wine on his tongue. I'm surprised you didn't barn the stadium down. Lisa, Angry slams down her fork. Dont be a wise ass mister. saved your tail. Anyhow, if you'd been listening to the kids at Berkeley instead of fooling around in a lab with your superbugs... Suddenly, from outside, where it Is now dark, we So youre back, Neville. That escape was very clever very "scientific. Neville goes on eating. Lisa looks up, her face frozen with an old fear, What's wrong... NothingOh, its his voice. Ill never get used to it, to hearing it. We were with him for a while, you know - He is surprised, Interested. With him? - When it happened when even the army fell apart and there was nobody left, Matthias would walk the streets at night ringing a bell. What people were left lived alone, like animals. Richie and had as a place In the back of a furniture store... We heard his bell, and we came out to see... And there were other people. We thought we were alone... Neville shakes his head. There were weapons, ears, food Lisa shakes her head almost angrily. And there were two kids completely alone, with the ruins-of the whole world and six million corpses around them. Matthias gave us the Family, for a while, What happened? - She stands now, walking amidst the books and paintings of the left side of the room. We helped with the burial, with the burning, but when it was done, when the worst was past... - We can hear the music, see the lights... it must be wonderful up there... everything a man could want. Lisa has paused as Matthias' distant comes into the room. She shivers and continues. They noticed how different we were. They hated our skin, our eyes, They resented us because we could still walk in the sunlight, enjoy the breeze and the flowers and the clouds rolling in from the oceans. - And one night, when they were awake and we slept, Matthias and the rest tried to kill all of us ... some of us got away And hid out. - During conclusion of last speech, Neville has risen and walked across room to her. Everything you could wantExcept another like yourself who looks at Neville. Her lips are moist, her eyes soft. to now two profiles. It's an awful thing to be alone, Neville, to be the last of something... Neville stretches out his hand. Lisa comes to meet it. - - It is quite dark and more as dark masses than as individual figures. as dialogue goes on, pausing at each to show the horror and loneliness of these creatures - They are all looking up, some without glasses. of brightly lit penthouse, - believe he's right, dont you? don't have to believe. know. If all this hadnt happened, what do you suppose you would have done. Sooner or later. dont know. Maybe I'd have stayed out one night, or walked downstairs, sooner or later. It's different now, for me... - As Lisa speaks, we the which is a constant sub-sound in all scenes in Neville's apartment, and then again, to proper pitch, then power fails completely. Lisa rises as Neville springs from table. Candles now are only illumination. Those bastards ... how could they get Into the garage? No, no ... it's out of gas. haven't fueled it in two days. As he talks, Neville is getting sten guns, flashlight, grenades. He tosses a sten gun to Lisa. You stay here. You won't need that, but still it'll make you more comfortable. Neville runs to elevator, pries open doors. - - Nevilles face, flashlight, peer into pitch dark. We in the of the Family on the garage door. - He climbs out trap door in roof of elevator, grabs elevator cables. of grows - scenes illuminated by flashlight at his belt. Prying open bottom elevator door. This should be rather hard with only inches to stand on, as he works. of is now deafening. As Neville finally stands in garage, resting against wall next to open elevator, he sees: - - His expression does not change as he pulls gun from shoulder sling, cocks It, opens fire at door. - The overrides of pain, from outside as the door is filled with scores of holes from Neville's gun. - He has a large battery light and is hustling five-gallon gasoline cans over to tank on generator. Pours gasoline. It is deathly except for from outside. - - She has heard the shooting, walks back and forth in the candlelight, nervous, - - They stand in the darkened plaza next to the now silent fountain. Zachary has a rope with a grapple on it. He throws it up to balcony of second floor. You may not have time, Zachary. He's in there, working, Zachary smiles. got more time than he does. When he comes back up, I'll be waiting. Don't be foolhardy. He has the devils luck. During his speech Matthias hands a to Zachary. - As he speaks, him snaking a pistol out of his boot, covertly shoving it into his belt under the robe he wears. Sure he does, But this time, the luck's run out. Gimme ten minutes and it's Paradise lost. Hang In, Brother. with expert agility Zachary climbs the rope to the second floor balcony. Then he tosses grapple to next floor, climbs. - He finishes, still in a sweat, Pauses for a moment to rest - Side view, Zachary breathing heavily, going up from third to fourth floor, for of his profile against the moon as he climbs rapidly. - Straight down into Zacharys face and empty white eyes as he climbs. Below, of we washed in pale moonlight, silent fountain He reaches fourth balcony, rests against rail. - stands, hands on back of chair, looking toward elevator. The doors are open. It is a dark hole. There is no sound. - He Is pulling rope to start generator. It will not turn over, he curses and tries again. On the fourth Pull, it connects, motor starts, lights, come on, flickering at first then steadily. Neville smiles, sighs with relief, Looks toward garage door. There is only silence. - showing plaza, balconies, and area behind plaza, bushes where Family lurks. As floodlights all grab eyes, pull hoods over their faces. Some in pain, stumble, writhe on ground, crawling to bushes. on who fumbles his sunglasses back in place and the shrubbery. - As on him, Zachary, pulling hood close, is just tossing grapple to fifth floor balcony. He is well under floodlights which are spaced every thirty feet or so above him and pointing oat. It is only the reflected and diffused light he must contend with. - She grapple land, reacts. Where did the sound come from? Was it close or distant? She stands now facing elevator, head turned. Then she hears (lights and are on again Already), It is the elevator-doors Generator is also on again, She watches elevator doors, What is coming up? Neville--or something else? - - We in Zachary appear on balcony. toss spear aside, pull gun. - As she watches, they open, Dark steps slowly light. It is Neville. He smiles at her reassuringly. Then of pistol being cooked, Nevilles face blazes with hatred. He swings sten gun up, seeming to aim directly at her. - Robert...? She falls away of line of fire. - Zachary is over balcony, covering his eyes with one arm. He is aiming pistol at Neville while covering eyes from light with left arm. - He fires. Bullets chew up drapery, wall. Bullets hit him, but he tries to Come on. The short bursts hit him, knocking him backward like a fire hose. He stumbles, rises covered with blood, his face unveiled now, blood on the pale skin, running into his blank eyes. burst knocks him back onto balcony and over it. He falls without a sound. - back to bushes beyond floodlights where Matthias is, from his - His face is contorted in pain. Other Family members (whispers) Oh, Brother, he won't be up there forever, promise you...I promise You - He lies sprawled on cement of plaza, eyes open, frozen, At last unaffected by the floodlights. In his right hand, we see the pistol. on Pistol. - He sees pistol, mouth twitches. His votes Is soft, sorrowful. as he speaks, Ah, so it wasnt Neville who brought Brother Zachary down. No, look. Neville was only an instrument of punishment, wasnt he? (murmurs of assent, Yes, Brother) Because Brother Zachary used forbidden things, he sinned against the night Matthias at Nevilles apartment. - Neville has dropped gun, walks slowly to Lisa who lies on floor, raised on one elbow. thought... Neville does not smile. Sure you did. You thought, the honkys freaked out. Give em time, It always comes to this... (considering) No, no.... She stands up with his hand to help her. (grinning) thought, it's got to be Matthias disguised in a Neville suit... Neville embraces her. - Eyes closed she still grins, reacts to his touch. She finds she is covered with grease from Nevilles slide down elevator cable. She smears some of the grease on his face. But theres nobody else like you, is there... (beat) ... you pale-face bastard. - Even the touch of a beautiful woman after so long does not quite dull his edge. What -was the old joke? "If you were the only girl in the world, and were the only boy, all right but until then, don't bother me." So guess you're the only girl in the world. (beat) You pretty black bitch. They kiss, break, look at each other: two people who've been through a lot for a long time. If there is a God, they want to thank Him for this chance to be human again. - - She is alone, reaches out for Neville. Sun strikes bed. She opens eyes, squints with more than normal reaction to sun. - She walks rapidly to balcony, draws blinds. She is nude. She rubs her eyes, looks at her hands. Stands in shadow, worried expression on her face. - He is door to Richies room. Neville does not see Lisa at first. He stands scratching head, considering how to proceed with Richie, walks over to laboratory facilities. How is he...? Neville does not glance up, is still studying. Stable. No loss of pigment since yesterday, vital signs steady. He's comfortable. He looks up, sees Lisa, smiles. Im sorry. was thinking. It is been a long time since had anyone to take care of... - She stands in the shadow, smiles. You haven't lost your touch. You take very good care. - as Neville walks over, as he kisses her lightly. They exchange amused looks. Well, let's get on with it. What? We take a ride. need some things for the serum. Want to come...? Richie...? Hell sleep for three or four hours. Well be back. - They are taking things from shelves. - before shelf, labeled She reaches up, takes down a bottle of pills, tosses it from hand to hand, grins at Neville. He returns the grin. Lisa tosses the bottle away. They walk from the drugstore hand in hand, Neville carrying a sack of supplies. - pulling up in front of a hospital. It is surrounded by cars, an ambulance has crashed on the emergency ramp. The scene should take into account the awful final days of the plague, and how it must have been at the hospitals. - Why dont you wait for me? There's no use your going in... Save it. You might need some help carrying things. - These should be recalling the actual dimensions of the city's final agony. Neville carries his sten gun, remains impassive as they walk. Lisa reacts to horrors despite her toughness. - corpses scattered-here and there. Some on stretchers, some on floors. - - walking through ward. - In each bed there is a corpse, desiccated, skeletal, some are lying, some sitting up. One is half out of bed. The horror is moderated by the darkness and shadows of the ward. There may be an in this of on when Zachary is killed. - Lisa looks straight ahead now. Neville, sten gun in right hand, keeps on lookout for Family members. - The dead nurses, desiccated, uniforms rotted, sit in various postures as death caught them. - -- it is light because of windows when Neville raises blinds. He looks around, spots a small centrifuge. Thats it. wonder if theres anything else. Lisa stands staring blankly at a calendar, March 1975. If there is, think about it. dont want to come back again. Neville looks up with a small patronizing smile. It gets to you, does it? I'm just fine, buddy. It would get to anybody who can feel... Look: it's over with. Make believe the dead are happy. - He has centrifuge, spots a white lab coat hanging on a clothes tree. Takes it down, looks at it, bundles it up and sticks it into centrifuge. Come on. Let's go play doctor. never learned that kind of make-believe. just keep wondering, why me? Why did live...? Because you were young, strong and resistant. Thank your genes. (bitter laugh) That's the first thing ever did have to thank them for. - - He lies with blood device in his arm. Lisa holds bulb to draw blood. Just squeeze it gently. Keep squeezing Till the bottle's full. (uneasily) Will one bottle ... be enough? on left side of It is empty. Neville and Lisa in Neville, Lisa in Its 160 proof Old Anglo-Saxon. One drop will ... (trying to hide her queasiness) Corrode your mind, send you running for the front of the bus... Well ... there arent any busses anymore. Go on. Start. As he says last line, she begins. Blood gushes up, begins to fill the bottle. - Centrifuge is turned on and begins to spin. was a very peculiar doctor those last years... looked for ways of treating diseases that hadnt existed... - drinking wine over sandwiches on-work table. ...until other doctors invented them. It was a peculiar world, wasn't it? It was what we made of it. Everybody helped. They paid for it. - Examining Richie. Finishes examination begins drawing blood with large syringe. But the last irony is Matthias. Look who gets left behind to play Noah after the flood. Noah is up for grabs, Robert. Matthias is only a contender. - Lisa smiles at him. to show Richie coming around. He looks up, suddenly terrified as he sees Neville. (weakly) Hey... Easy, baby. Its all right... Where are we? Did they get us...? Nobodys got us, Richie. You remember that place where there was light? The place where the creeps all came at night trying to bring it down? Yeah, sure... This is it. This is Neville. He's ...the landlord, guess. (slyly) Richie eases back, somewhat reassured. How sick is he? Lisa smiles sardonically at Neville. He isnt hardly sick at all, honey. Maybe just a little spooked once in a while. He's going to get you well. Well, hell. You know there aint no way... I'm going to try. What have you got-to loose? Richie smiles up at him. Nothin' man. Not a thing. You go it, hear? He will, baby. He will. - on the slide we being attached and destroyed by other cells. dont know how much it will take. Ill draw blood as often as can. Well just have to keep pumping it to him. (tired) How long do you think it will take? How do know? Maybe it wont work at all... Who do you think am, Louis Pasteur? - that she is a little lighter than in past scenes. Streaking in her hair should now be somewhat noticeable. But its a chance... - He looks up from microscope. Yeah, and it ought to be your chance. You need this stuff, too. Not as bad as he does. And anyhow, he's my brother... Neville studies her a moment. That's why he is getting it first. (beat) And if it works, you understand what that should mean, don't you? Lisa looks puzzled. What? Hell be the source of more antibodies. The more people we can inject, the more we'll have serum for...the others. And when thats done, we'll pull out. We'll take what we need, and head for the mountains and the valleys ... think of what's out there... - She is listening, but her expression shows that she is preoccupied with other thoughts. Neville has left workbench and walks across apartment. Lisa walks with him. They stop near liquor cabinet. whole world. Vines, fields that will grow anything we want to plant. Streams full of fish again. Stands of timber... You sound almost... Almost what? Almost glad that it ... happened. Neville pours a drink, mixes one for Lisa. He looks up coldly, almost angrily. I'm not glad, but Im not moaning, either. told them in Biowar, you people are crazy. This kind of research... (breaks off) ...Ah, why do you think was a colonel instead of a lieutenant general? Now they know. No, they dont know a goddamned thing. They're dead. We know. (beat) Forget it. Its not worth our time. He takes off lab coat, climbs into coveralls, gets sten gun, belt with flashlight, grenades, etc. He cocks sten gun, checks pouch for ammo, checks flashlight. - Where are you 'going? Dont you need some rest? - This is the way rest...Ill be back before sundown. Dont worry. Robert... Later... - - - She looks sad, subdued tears in her eyes. - empty and the fountain splashes untended. We a small on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower. Please...I brought you this stuff. Don't let them take me either, and put me in a bag. Please. She the of an roaring closer and races terror-struck, for her bicycle. As she Neville's car crosses the plaza at speed, slowing only enough for the garage doors to open and The girl's offering lies unheeded on the fountain. - is injecting Richie with serum. The boy is unconscious, mumbling deliribusly. ...got to move fast, keep on moving. That Matthias, he wants you. All the cops want' you. They gonna get you, boy, they gonna make you come over, you hear? This dialogue in background while Neville and Lisa (who is in dressing room) talk. - looking in mirror at a streak of silver in her hair. What do you think...? - don't. We'll have to see. - she uses mascara to cover the light streak in her hair. Stares at herself in mirror. He's all the brother Ive got, all the family...in this world. Don't sweat. This is his best chance. - If there were time, I'd have trapped one of Matthias' things and tried the serum on it. Lisa bristles at this. What do you mean "things Arent they human, too? Yeah ... guess you could call them that. How many are there? Forty? ... Fifty? The last of those four billion steamy bodies that were crawling around last time somebody took a count. They were a dandy bunch weren't they? They did the best they could. Who the hell are you to put down the human race? Me? I'm nobody, baby ... but at least know it. was just part of the crowd, and didn't think much of it. Well do! They made the world...that's what it was all about. No, honey...they it ... we're living in what they made of it, and God help us. Pretty soon those sick animals out there'll be gone, and then we will be too and all that'll be left is this (points to his collection of cultural artifacts) That one Rembrandt's worth more than everyone left alive in this stinking city! Maybe in a hundred years or so Godll get around to kicking through the ashes down here and read Shakespeare and say, "Well ... maybe it was worth it." I've heard that kind of talk before, you uppity, honky pig...and Ohhh, lovely! Yeah ... I've heard kind of talk before, too, and that got everybody a hell of a long way, didn't it? There're just about enough of us here to go through all that again, right? (more) You can found a Panther cell, and can start up a White Citizens Council! Or shall be the and you can be the whole damn Harvard faculty?! Too bad we don't have enough folks around to do the United Nations over, isn't it! - She is boiling, but holds her control. She speaks quietly, matter-of-factly. Neville, you are a bastard. class-A bastard. - Where are you headed? Lisa stops, turns. know it doesn't mean much to you, but it happens this is an anniversary. Two years ago today, all those no-good people you just wrote off, died in this town. I've got a mother and father Richie and buried with our own hands out there, after the Army stopped burning the bodies. Id like to go visit them, if it's all right with you! Neville studies her for a long moment. Sure, it's all right. He tosses her something below as he speaks. Take this with you. - catches a sten gun, stands holding it, looks down at it, back up toward Neville. - rapidly, purposefully. She is walking along a path with grass grown up on both sides. now that she is walking in a cemetery. The graves are overgrown, some of the stones fallen. The place is in general disrepair. - She pushes aside some tall weeds and stands before a place relatively cleared, where someone has put gravel to keep down the weeds and has carefully outlined a large grave-site with coke and seven-up bottles by burying them in the ground neckdown. There is a faded plaque of wood, probably the bottom of an orange-crate or something more substantial. On it are the names and dates of her parents: Richard and Lorena McNally Born, Montgomery, Alabama Died, Los Angeles, California 1977 In front of the marker are a couple of tin coffee cans with the remains of long-wilted flowers in them. She stands for a moment, silent, near tears. Then she speaks in a low, almost conversational tone. Listen, know don't come like should. But it's hard times, momma, daddy. You never knew what hard times was. You only thought you did. Suddenly, above her monologue, she a It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the sten gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing. - Perhaps some thirty meters away through the weeds and grass, she sees a crypt. It, too, is overgrown with moss, ivy, and has not been cared for. - She slowly approaches crypt, gun ready, a little on edge, curious. Oh, God ... oh... Lisa stops as she this then moves cautiously around to front of crypt. The door is ajar slightly. Again, like Neville, after a pause, she kicks door jumps past it, glancing inside. - - Lisa is outlined against the bright summer sky, her shadow long, only her silhouette visible. She stands looking inside. her gun ready. Her expression is one of astonishment, utter sorrow. - The woman, a hood over her head and shoulders like a shawl, kneels beside a tiny body laid out on rags. Her fingers touch its leg or arm. She faces the body as Then she turns very slowly to her left, looks up at Lisa from the deep shadows. - - Her face is dead white, white hair straggled around it. Her eyes are the blank white of all Matthias' people. And there are tears running down her cheeks. In but clearly visible, of the dead child, its eyes, too, are white, blank. It is obviously a newborn infant. - - The gun falls to her side. She stands for a moment watching the woman. I'm ... sorry... - She turns and from the crypt, back the way she has come. - It is late afternoon. The fountain bubbles, its water spewing into the air and cascading down From one level to another, over the sides and into the bottom pool. drawing Neville showing was from - Arms folded, he stands watching fountain splash. He enjoys watching it. approaching in near distance. - Lisa pulls parks the car, and gets out slowly, carrying her gun listlessly. She is absorbed in thought, stops a little behind Neville on the far side of fountain. She wears sunglasses and a scarf though it is not bright. Her hair has a few subtle streaks in it and her skin has lightened also. Neville has glanced at the car as it arrived, is now turned back to fountain. It's an illusion, you know. It looks like a tapped spring, but theres nothing new ... the same water coming up over and over again... Lisa says nothing. He's better. His skins a little darker; cant tell about his eyes yet. - Lisa is restless. She walks around fountain, looks through at Neville from the far side. He's got eyes like his momma, big and soft. Melting brown. I'll know when they're right. She always said held give the girls hell. And he would...if there were any girls. - - He is looking past fountain. Did you find ... your people? - Lisa in not looking at Neville. Yes. Right where we put them down. We talked a while. (beat) And then something happened. on Neville again. He glances through fountain at Lisa. Oh...? - - Lisa walks slowly back and forth, not looking at Neville, profile to us. couple of Matthias' people were out there... Neville in looking at Lisa, interested. Did you take care of them? - Lisa turns to fade him now, angrily. did not. didnt do a goddamned thing but look and choke and run. - - He looks puzzled at her angry response. As she continues, his expression changes to one of compassion. Because one of them was a dead baby Stillborn, like all of them. And the other one was its mother. And because don't go around shooting mothers and babies Anyhow... - ...and because In nine months could be on my knees right where she was... - His reaction to Lisa's announcement of possible pregnancy. What are you talking about? - - She is turned away from Neville, looking still angry. Well, now, man, Im not sure. mean, missed my appointment with the obstetrician and he was out of rabbits anyhow. But was sick as a hound dog this morning and right now feel like Ive been eating weeds. Well I'll be damned... - turns toward him. That is a damn good bet. - Neville walks around fountain to join Lisa. She turns, looks up at him, rises. They embrace, kiss, walk toward garage entrance together. - is with It moves a little back and forth. Does that hurt...? little ... yeah, it hurts. How about off man? - Richie's color is now clearly returning. His hair is perhaps dark blond, light tan. Lisa is smiling. So is Neville. week ago, that much light would have driven you crazy. Richie snaps his fingers. He is a tough young man, not easily impressed, but his recovery has made him demonstrative. (sings) ...I'm beginning to see the light... (to Lisa) Hes doing fine. We can move him any-time now. (to Richie) Get some rest. Youre going to need it. - Move him...? Sure. I'll have another batch of the serum ready in a few hours, and that's It. We'll load up the Land Rover in the garage, meet Dutch and the others and head out. How about the Sierras? Maybe Washington...it doesn't matter. - who smiles with delight at the news. - Neville goes to his laboratory workbench. Lisa calls back to Richie. What you want to eat, honey? Gimme some more of that great chicken soup...Ugh! Lisa goes to cabinet for soup, takes it to stove. (to Richie) Listen, you feel like coming out here to eat it? Sure. You better ask the man, though. Hey... grinning. All right. Put on that robe brought you. And walk easy. You may feel a little giddy. Lisa kisses Neville. He's been giddy for 18 years. Lisa has a gun, wears her sunglasses and a shoulder purse. What are you up to? You say we're going to leave. I'm going to hit the stores. What pick up today, youre going to be seeing for a long time. Neville pauses in his work, looks concerned. Why don't you skip it. In those stores, some of them... (laughing) The most dangerous thing ever came across in those stores was ... you. (seriously) Look, got my gun. - - Neville shrugs, half-smiling. Watch yourself. Stay on the round floors, close to the doors in the light...and if you see anything, shoot. (impatiently) Sure. And honey... Neville glances up questioningly. Can have your credit cards...? On the way down, she takes off her glasses. Her expression is one of fatigue. Under her scarf, the streak In her hair is mach more evident. Her complexion seems lighter than before. - - - She pauses to look In the windows of various shops Doors are frequently open, window displays fallen down, Cars parked along street are rusted, flat tires, etc. In one or two cars, one can a hint of a decayed - dressed In Neville's robe, many sizes too large for him. He eats slowly, reflectively. In Neville is preparing to draw more blood. Is that going to be for me...? No, you dont need any more. This Is for Lisa. She has to get it before... Before she goes bad like did. Lemme ask you something. Would that stuff work on say Matthias? - Richie helps Neville, draw blood. Pint bottle on table. It might. There's no way to tell for sure. - There's one way... - Forget It. Weve got...what? Six, eight kids to look after including Dutch. can't use any more of my blood till we're clear of this place and can afford the weakness... - How about mine? - Later. In a month...if your blood count is good, if you gain weight...but not soon. - Neville pulls needle. Bottle is full. He wipes arm with cotton, stands up, stretches. That's not all of it, Chief. If there was a cow that gave two quarts of that serum a day, you still wouldnt (beat) ... go to Matthias, As he says the last part of speech, it is clear that Richie is formulating for the first time what he thinks should be done, - There Is a kind of pillbox on the roof formed of sandbags. Topside is mounted a light machine gun aimed toward the roof access way. Neville is sitting on sandbags, Richie standing. Okay, you're right. The hell with them. But... they're part of the human race You say. Your sister says. But when the wheel topped turning, got left with the decisions and say Matthias and his collection of loonieseven cured...would ruin a fresh start. - He is angry in turn. You come on real stronglike Youd wipe out the whole Family If told you where they hole up. - His Interest is aroused. Does Richie know where the Family stays? The rat's nest? Just try me. - He has walked away from Neville. Now he whirls. All right. Theyre down In the Federal Court building. That's where they stay. Go, man, go. - stands at pillbox, his arm over canvas coveted machine-gun. His expression changes from disbelief to astonishment. Federal Court building, Neville drinking, looking out at building as on p. 26 So that's where they were all the time, - Smiles wryly. Well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you gonna go zap em? Kill, you got to kill - He looks a little sheepish, between anger and laughter. There's no time now. I've got to- go set it up with Dutch for tomorrow... - He smiles at Neville, his liking and respect returned. Gee, you really a mean ass, aint you? Neville smiles at him. was, you little bastard Till got mixed up with you and your sister and the rest of the Katzenjammer kids. They exchange looks of real affection. - We him to the house in which Dutch and the others live. Dutch to meet him. Richie...? Beautiful. The staff works. I've got blood drawn to make up some for Lisa. We'll start on the rest of you in a week or so. You're using a lot of Juice, Doc. How do you feel? Fine. No problem. They walk, looking into canyon. It's a nice world. Somebody ought to do something with It. Its all ours, Dutch. Can you be ready to travel in the morning? - In wine shop. She smiles, reaches up and takes from shelf a bottle of wine, examines it critically, puts it in her large cloth shopping bag. - - He is talking earnestly. not all that different from them, man. You got to try. Right? You can't walk away. Don't you see? You're a good man... showing Richie dressing, pulling on a shirt, talking to the bust of Caesar now on a shelf, still wearing the overseas cap, But you dont listen. You go your own way. Well, this time It's gonna be my way, you know? My way He is dressed now and walks purposefully toward elevator. He pauses, looking at arsenal, goes over, picks up a flashlight, finds a scrap of paper, writes something on it, puts in gun barrel. elevator. of Richie's as - Sure. Where are we going? - Away. Somewhere no one bothered with before, on a river nobody dammed, in mountains that were too far to build highways to. Where everything we do... ...will be the first time it's been done there Neville and Dutch exchange grins. Youve got the idea. Like we were the first peopleonly this time dont trust no snakes. They Neville and Dutch walking back to his car. You want as at your place, the crack of dawn, huh? Neville's reverie is interrupted. Huh? Oh, yes. Right. as they shake hands then to as Neville drives away. Dutch waves, watches him go. See you, tomorrow, Moses. - undressing, trying on dresses In front of a large, three-panel mirror. She stands nude in the shadow, changing to a new dress. She steps into medium light before mirror, sees that she is much lighter, her hair is heavily streaked. - in a fine mood, doing a dance step now and then, hands in pockets. He pauses in front of leather goods store. - He now wears an expensive leather jacket such as he could never have afforded In the past. He walks on. - - door opens as begins. Neville puts left toward liquor at blast of Caesar. Well, wonder If we'll have room for You He strolls to balcony, looks out over plaza, fountain. Richie... (beat) Richie... Neville frowns, turns back toward interior of apt. - - as on the note, stuck in the barrel of the gun nearest Neville. Neville walks rapidly heading for note. Neville reads note. going to find out whos right: you or me... He frowns quizzically. Whos right? You or ... me... - looks up, suddenly understanding the note's meaning. Matthias ... my God, that stupid kid! Neville rapidly begins loading up on equipment. He takes down grenades, a satchel-charge, extra clips for the sten gun, flashlight, etc. - Slings sten gun over shoulder, turns, into elevator. - - - Looks up at the imposing building, his eyes traveling along its front. He looks wary, as if he wishes he had not embarked on this particular venture. Then he shrugs, starts up steps. - going up steps. Pauses at the dark open door, then walks In quickly, impulsively. - - - sitting at cosmetics table now, over her shoulder, Her face is light, hair blond, eyes green. She smears-dark pancake makeup on cheek, trying desperately to pretend to herself that she is not changing over. Her light hand slows down at she sees the hopelessness of it. Her face reflects fear and hopelessness. - walking into court building, as Richie walks down dark deserted corridors. They seem almost to form a maze, - as he rounds a corner, he stops, looks up, mouth open In horror. past shoulder of or is staring at. - - It is a very large statue of Justice, holding scales and sword. moves up to on blinded eyes. - He is relieved, but still fearful, almost ready to run. He turns, about to retrace his steps, perhaps to give it up, to leave. as he turns back, he is grabbed on both sides from shadows. - - In this and following, the shook effect of their eyes and dead white faces should be maximized. - - face paralyzed with fear, as they drag him of - rounding corner suicidally, headed for court building. We notice for first time that it is well into the afternoon, the sun standing fairly low in the sky. - - Face grim, determined. He twists wheel viciously as he rounds another corner. - held between his two captors. Matthias voice is soft, reassuring. What is your name? Richie tries to answer, but is near panic. What Is your name? Once you were among us... - arriving In front of court building, drives up on Sidewalk, up on steps if possible, piles out of car, gets equipment, runs into building. - This scene is in courtroom where Neville was brought earlier. Candle gutters, focus goes to Richie. All right, Richard. Why did you come back here? Richie is getting a little control back, He is still terrified, but his belief in his mission has returned. came to help you. You know the man... Matthias' voice is low, without Inflection. Neville... That's him, yeah. Listen, he's got a serum for... For...? - ...for what's wrong with you. If you could just talk to him, get with him ... then everybody could be Yes, everybody could be..? Richie swallows. He does not like to use the word. ... Everybody could be...normal again. Matthias behind table, a candle to one side of him. He wears his glasses. We could be as we were before? Yes. guess so. The way we were... His voice trails off. From this point on, with each successive speech, Matthias gets looms becomes slightly up. Matthias walks around table. (wearily) The way we were... Is that what Neville thinks we want? It that why he sent you...? No, listen: he didn't send me... Matthias removes his glasses as he approaches Richie. (loader, irrationally) Oh, yes. He did send you, One way or the other, you came back to offer us something from his world, to change us back, cripple us, destroy our dedication to what must be done. was almost like you, but he saved me ... brought me back. He wants as all to go away from here... He damned you. Don't you see? If 'you had come over, if you had the marks, wouldn't have to do...this! Matthias loons huge, terrifying. His hands are below but as his speech concludes, he moves his arm, shoulder brutally. - His eyes stare, his mouth is open. He stands for a moment, strangling. Blood rushes out of his mouth and he falls. on his dead face. Prepare the Family. Tonight think Neville mightcome out. - At first we the of his as he moves He is looking for the courtroom he remembers. So many damn rooms ... it could take all day... He glances at his watch, moves on. shows him moving away, beginning to trot. - talking as quickly to revealing Family gathered in their rags with spears, knives, etc. ... so the time has come. Tonight we must bring him down. If he leaves, one day he will come back and destroy us. Tonight, tonight, tonight... The Family picks up Matthias word like a "tonight, tonight." - It is dark now. She is walking out of store, arms filled with bottles, packages. She wears glasses, scarf. We do not see her face. toward her slowly. we the moving down the street close by. Lisa stops, freezes, turns toward - They are marching down the street half a block away, perpendicular to the street upon which Lisa stands. - - We see Lisas back as she watches Family marching past in They carry candles, chant. ...outside the Family, there is nothing at all... As we watch, Lisa stands frozen. Then she lets her packages slowly slip from her arms. - The bottle falls to the pavement, breaks. The red wine soaks the sidewalk. - This is still a She slowly reaches up, pulls off her scarf, tosses away her sunglasses. As her hair Is revealed we It is now almost pure silver (not white, silver). She begins walking toward the street where the Family marches. It is dusk now, almost dark. as Lisa gets smaller, walking into distance, - Neville moves approaching the door slowly, carefully. He stands next to door, out of the way, opening It with his fingertips When it is loose, he kicks It open quickly. Inside it is pitch black. Neville stands in corridor, next to door, back against the wall. He cannot see inside. - He is sweating now. In the darkness he cannot handle himself as well as in the lights. He swings his penlight inside, looks around quickly. He sees nothing but the table and a few smoking candle stabs on It. He hears a sound, a scuttling, as If someone were tip toeing from one place to another. Neville palls a concussion grenade out of his satchel, pulls the pin with his teeth, holds it in his left hand. He turns, tosses the grenade into the room and covers his ears. The is deafening, sounding down the corridors. This is very brief - as the booming of the moves along them. - From Inside room where grenade has gone off. In the dim light, bluish smoke drifts. We at edge of door. Well, Matthias don't you have anything to say? There Is silence. Neville waits, then dives Into flashlight held out to one side, sten gun ready. He lies on his belly scanning room. It seems empty. Preach to me, brother... - He lies looking from side to side. It is still silent. Then his flashlight stops. - - dead in judges seat. We Richies head thrown back, blood still oozing from his mouth, eyes open. His expression is hard, bat it is obvious that the boys death has moved him. What a waste, Richie, what a stupid waste. He turns and walks slowly back toward from behind the bench, centered on Neville, across Richies body. - Neville walks downcast. He looks up. It is night. Neville frowns. Lisa...Ive got to get back... He runs, jumps races headlights on. - - - We ahead. Then, on one side, a dark Avoiding Nevilles headlights, throwing something. Move to of windshield, as bricks hits, shatters it. - - - As he rounds corner, we pushing a car out to block him. They scatter as Neville approaches. - He twists wheel to avoid collision. - He manages to avoid the car Matthias' creatures have pushed in front of him, but he sideswipes car at curb, goes out of control, crashes into storefront. - - Neville's car amidst dust, smoke, debris inside wrecked toy store. is past of Store is full of figures of clowns, animals, bizarre toys. - Another huge toy smashed by Neville's car. Neville rises sten gun ready, small cut on head. He rubs away blood, squints outside. as he steps over debris - We see him in running through silent empty street. - He stands against the side of a building, breathing deeply. He is weakened by the loss of blood in making serum. Then a spear or arrow the bricks next to him. He whirls, shoots. - This is from beyond the creature who has tried to kill Neville. Neville is in far sten gun aimed at the creature. The creature lies on the pavement, bleeding, twitching. as Neville begins running again, this time directly running over the body of the thing he has killed. - We see him running from above the street. He is about a half-block from the apartment. We see his from this We see of the in the street running toward Neville. He still running. Cuts them down. - - He stands before the apt. The fountain is running, floodlights on. He is dog-tired, but relieved. He smiles and walks carefully glancing at the shrubs and shadows. - We see fleetingly the profile of one of Matthias thus suggesting that there are many watching his progress. He stops in front of garage, presses button on his remote control. - - exhausted downhearted from Richie's foolish death. His eyes are closed. - is across int. of apt. It is dark. One candle is lit on chess table. This candle is in left on candle as As elevator door opens, Neville steps out. He frowns.
