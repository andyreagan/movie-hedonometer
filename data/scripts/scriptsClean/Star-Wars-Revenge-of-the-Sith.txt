In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.

We've been waiting for you. We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him. As a dozen more droids join the group, the ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back. Anakin. . . Ready. and use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor. 12 The cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it. . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting. Well then, we're safe for the time being. Your idea of safe is not the same as mine. They run, rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, drop into the fuel. The throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with excess power dischargers. They're sealing this section off. Six droids coming our way! The last of the in the distance. Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way. They move along a wall. climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the dischargers. We'll never get through that. It's too small!

Just before he is about to drown, disables the by pushing him into an exhaust pipe. The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose. found our escape vent. Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here. Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . . grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the swim closer. 13 The pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube. Here's a way out. As the reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch. 14 The climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end. 15 hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the squeeze out, the hatch. Behind them, seals the hatch with his laser sword. That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers. The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized. You still have much to learn, Anakin. 16 The climb up the vent shaft. and wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger. have a bad feeling about this. 17 The fuel hits the power discharger, and there is a 18 and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser. 19 large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the hits. jumps back, then stands amazed. All right, you win. have much to learn. Let's go! grins at and they run down the hallway. 20 The two wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with The start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. frantically pushes the elevator button several more times. Destroyers!! Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The turn to see standing behind them. Drop your weapons! said drop 'em. The activate their light sabers and destroy all the 21 notices two entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter. 22 The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.

They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted. 1: What's that? 2: Get back to work. It's nothing. 24 Artoo? climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator. (continuing) Always on the move. continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply. 25 tries to muffle the comlink as the try to figure out where the voices are coming from. extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface. Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo. 26 Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as wires rain down on him. 27 The elevator starts to descend rapidly. Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up. 28 Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and appear in the doorway and look down at They point their guns at him. 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move. 2: Roger, roger. 29 The overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to 1: There it is again. Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down. 30 The elevator races down as holds on. Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop! The elevator stops with a jolt. falls to the floor. 31 The see and walk toward the little droid. 1: Hey you! plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up. 32 stands up after having fallen in the elevator. Now, that's better . . . 33 is held up by who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them. 1: You stupid little astro droid! 34 looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft. Before can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the in two. lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. is startled and ignites his lightsaber. Oh, it's you . . . 35 activates his oil hose and sprays the The slip on the oil. 36 What was that all about? Well, Artoo has been . . . No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can. Did say anything? He's trying! didn't say anything! 37 ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. rolls away. 38 The elevator door opens and the carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters. At the far end sits and move toward the As they get closer to they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face. (bows) Chancellor. Are you all right? (quietly) Count Dooku. makes a small gesture with his hand. and turn around. The elevator as strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi. (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together. was about to say that. jumps down to the main level. Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord. Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty. and throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers. Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor. and move toward You won't get away this time, Dooku. and charge great sword fight ensues. I've been looking forward to this. My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. Good. Twice the pride, double the fall. lunges at the and they fall back . . .

The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto spins and kicks sending him over the balcony. Jumps, following him down to the main floor. and continue the fight. (continuing) sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you dont use them. Anakin regains his composure and attacks as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense. Anakin attacks with a new ferociousness. 39 Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, cuts off DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. stumbles to the floor as puts the two lightsabers to his neck. is grinning as he watches DOOKU's defeat. Good, Anakin, good. knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now! shouldn't . . . Do it!! cuts off DOOKU's head. huge somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything. ... couldn't stop myself. You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. drops DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. raises his hands toward who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose. (continuing) shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way. stands up, rubbing his wrists. It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. The ship begins to list to one side. rushes over to lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. heads for the elevators. (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late. He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right. Leave him, or we'll never make it. His fate will be the same as ours. picks up slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators. 40 Prepare for attack. All batteries fire! Fire! 41 Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed.

(continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in! 43 Windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space. Reverse stabilizers. 44 As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment from one side of the ship to the other. Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. starts to slide toward one of the small holes. 45 As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway. clings to the doorframe with on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him. 46 continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the One bolt hits very near him, and he in terror. 47 Magnetize! Magnetize! 48 is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him. 49 The heads straight down toward the planet. 50 jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with still on his shoulder. We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast. climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other. 51 Fire the emergency booster engines. Leveling out, sir. 52 still carrying on his back, and run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing and to start sliding down the shaft. grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft. 53 and hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. regains consciousness and tries to look around. Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation. Did miss something? looks down and sees and the bottomless pit. They hear on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them. Hold on. What is that? and look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then turns to (continuing) Oops. Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator! Too late! Jump! They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal. and take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by. 54 and fly through the elevator door and land. Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on. Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy? 55 As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken He looks around then rockets up out of the debris. 56 and lead down a hallway toward the hangar bay. 57 It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay. None of those ships will get us anywhere. agree. What are we going to do? don't know. Don't look at me. don't know. and both look to He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side. Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on. We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod. hands the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. attaches it around his waist. and throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes. 58 grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the blowing them up. and follow along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by and as the ship twists and tries to break apart. moves out of the steam and struggles to pull back to safety. is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them. 59 and are out of breath. Well, that was close. They laugh. 60 General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328. Activate ray shields. 61 They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway. Ray shields! takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment. Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this. Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... was distracted. Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault. You're the Master. I'm just a hero. I'm open to suggestions here. Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous.

Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . . comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.

That wasn't much of a rescue. walks to and hands him the lightsabers. That depends upon your point of view. Hah! And Anakin Skywalker ... was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older. General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than expected. Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . . Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do. Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection. Not this time. And this time you won't escape. Artoo. creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around. hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds.

You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time. Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . . All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness. . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians. All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . . Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing. smiles and walks away from The and his entourage approach WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right? Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again. WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward. That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive. WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority. and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.

In fact, could do with a tune-up myself. 70 is at the back of the crowd of talking with and scoot along ahead of them.

SlDIOUS: General Grievous, suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar. It will be done, My Lord. SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and promise you, victory is assured. The hologram of Sidious talks to about the death of Count Dooku. But the loss of Count Dooku? SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory.

The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda. Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.

What's wrong then? The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today. Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war. Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine. Be careful of what? He has requested your presence. What for? He would not say. He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it? All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed. know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust? The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings. 80 stands with at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. brown haze hangs over the landscape. Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council. The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate? They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things. agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way. There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security. With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments. Thank you, my friend, but in this case have no choice . . . this war must be won. Everyone will agree on that. Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. have advised you over the years when could ... am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. hope you trust me, Anakin. Of course. need your help, son. What do you mean? fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. find simply incomprehensible in a democracy. can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir. Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you. For what? don't understand. To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . . thinks about this. (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council. Me? Master? am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this. think they will . . . they need you more than you know. 81 and and sit in Senator Organa 's office. Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic. When did this happen? The decree was posted this morning. Do you think he will dismantle the Senate? Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists. The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day. We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight. looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said. What are you suggesting? apologize. didn't mean to sound like a Separatist. We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic. It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy. can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when was Queen. GlDDEAN Senator, fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate. The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it. We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and are putting together an organization . . . Say no more. Senator Organa. understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid. Yes. agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing. That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told. They nod their heads. considers this for a moment. Agreed. 82 stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers.

Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine. understand. You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master. Anakin reacts with anger. What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master? Take a seat, young Skywalker. Forgive me, Master. goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. speaks. Kl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous. Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep. It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare. We cannot take ships from the front line. And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup. Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees? It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately! He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant. know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet. Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous. Go, will. Good relations with the Wookiees, have. It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all. is disappointed. 84 and walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. is furious. What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting! Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs. swear to you, didn't ask to be put on the Council . . . But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. That has nothing to do with this. Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation. You mean divided loyalties. warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it. The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve. No, it is not. Anakin, worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts. Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. know where my loyalties lie. hope so . . . sense there's more to this talk than you're saying. Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you. And? Anakin, look, am on your side. didn't want to see you put in this situation. What situation? (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to. They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason! We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not. Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session? This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally. The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since arrived here. That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired. Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer. Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place. You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me? The Council is asking you. 85 heads for the huge Clone landing platform. 86 and ride in the as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting. : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm. Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.

With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force? So the prophecy says. prophecy . . . that misread could have been.

Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills. They still treat me as if were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem. Anakin . . . Sometimes, wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? (suspicious) What do you mean? What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy? don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist! Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy! What is it? Nothing. Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you. You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.

You wanted to see me, Chancellor. Yes, Anakin! Come closer. have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system. At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing. They try. Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us. sits next to The Chancellor leans over to him. (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. I'm not sure understand. You must sense what have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me. don't think . . . Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you? know they don't trust you . . . Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter. have to admit my trust in them has been shaken. Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? doesn't say anything. He simply looks down. (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they? don't know ... don't know what to say. Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi. The Jedi use their power for good. Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . . . . . evil. . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful. The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves. And the Jedi don't? The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others. smiles. Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong? I'm not sure it's wrong. Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith. is deep in thought. (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"? No. thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. He could actually save people from death? The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. What happened to him? He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself. Is it possible to learn this power? Not from a Jedi. 89 flanked by approaches the tree housing the 90 and various speak via hologram. The discussion includes and Kl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents. (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there. partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau. Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed. Does everyone agree? All the concur. The Chancellor has requested that lead the campaign. They all look at a bit disturbed. (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor. Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make. is embarrassed and becomes sullen. Master is needed, with more experience. Given our resources, recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.

Oh no, you're quite right, but do have the most experience with his ways of combat. Obi-Wan, my choice is. Kl-ADI-MUNDI: concur. Master Kenobi should go. agree. All the concur. Very well.

We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this. only wish to discuss this with one . . . one trust. GiDDEAN Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky. The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . . Patience, Senator. We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.

Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi.
