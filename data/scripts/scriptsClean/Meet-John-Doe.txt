The activity of the office seems to suddenly cease, as all eyes are centered on the office boy. Med. shotpanning: With the office boywho has a small sheet of paper in his hand. He walks jauntily to a desk, refers to his paper, points his finger to a woman, emits a short whistle through his teeth, runs a finger across his throat and jerks his thumb toward managing editor's office. The woman stares starkly at him while her immediate neighbors look on with sympathy. The office boy now goes through the same procedure with several other people. All watch him, terror written in their eyes. Med. shot: Toward CONNELL's office door where painter works. It opens and three people emerge. Two men and a girl. The girl is young and pretty. All three look dourful. The painter again has to wait for the door to shut before resuming his work. The two men exit. The girl suddenly stops. Close shot: Of the girl.

She begins to pound furiously, her jaw set. Close-up: Of Eyes flashing as she types. Close-up: Of watching her.

He pours out his soul to me, and from now on we quote: protest, by John Doe." He protests against all the evils in the world; the greed, the lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's inhumanity to man. Arguments will start. Should he commit suicide or should he not! People will write in pleading with him. But no! No, sir! John Doe will remain adamant! On Christmas Eve, hot or cold, he goes! See?

The painter stares at it, helplessly for a second, and thenunable to stand it any more, rises, throws his brush violently to the floorafter completely smearing the sign himself.

Ann leans over his shoulder. peers over his other shoulder. can read. can read! Sorry. She backs away. continues reading her confession. So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you? (very carelessly) Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap. Packs everything, including a gun. (flings paper on desk) Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.

Wider shot: To include and the others. Kept me up half the night saying "That man's right, honey. The trouble with the world isnobody gives a hoot about his neighbor. That's why everybody in town's sore and cranky at each other." And kept saying, "Well, that's fine, but how's a guy gonna go around loving the kind of neighbors we got? Old Sourpuss for instance!" (laughing) You see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy who lives all alone next door to us. He's a cranky old man and runs a second-hand furniture store. We haven't spoken to him for years. always figured he was an ornery old gent that hated the world cause he was always slamming his garage door and playing the radio so loud he kept half the neighbors up. (laughing) Close-up: Of Well, anyway, the next morning I'm out watering the lawn and look over and there's Sourpuss on the other side of the hedge straightening out a dent in his fender and, er, my wife yells to me out of the window. She says, "Go on. Speak to him, Bert." And figured, well, heck, can't lose anythingso yelled over to him "Good morning, Mr. Smithers." He went right on pounding his fender, and was burned! So turned around to give my wife a dirty look and she said, "Louder, louder. He didn't hear you." So, in a voice you could of heard in the next county, yelled. "Good morning, Mr. Smithers!" Med. shot: Featuring and is very interested. Well, sir, you coulda knocked me over with a feather. Old Sourpuss turned around surprised like, and he put on a big smile, came over and took my hand like an old lodge brother, and he said. "Good morning, Hansen. I've been wanting to talk to you for years, only thought you didn't like me." And then he started chatting away like a happy little kid, and he got so excited his eyes begin waterin' up. Med. shot: Of a group of neighbors. They smile sympathetically. Well, Mr. Doe, before we got through, found out Smithers is a swell egg, only he's pretty deaf, and that accounts for all the noises. Wider shot: To include and others. And he says it's a shame how little we know about our neighbors, and then he got an idea, and he said, "How's about inviting everybody some place where we can all get together and know each other a little better?" Well, I'm feeling so good by this time, I'm ripe for anything. Close shot: Of and They listen, amused and excited. So Smithers goes around the neighborhood inviting everybody to a meeting at the school house and tell everybody that comes in the store, including Mr. Schwabacher, my boss. (laughing) Oh, I'm talking too much. Med. shot: and Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another. Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey. Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey. His comes forward and stands beside him. This is my wife, Mr. Doe. nods her head shylyand acknowledges the introduction by a half wave of his hand. How do you do, Mr. Doe . . . Er, Sourpuss is here, too. (turns around) Oh, is he? (pointing) Uh-huh. Med. shot: Of a group around He is as described, except when he smiles, his whole face warms up. Those around him push him forward.

Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural. (laughing) There are snickers from the background. Well, anyway, guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving." Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it. Close shot: Of Profoundly impressed by this. Wider shot: clears his throat. Yeah. And, well, sir, a half a dozen of us ran over there to fetch them and we got them to the meeting. What a reception they got. Why, everybody shook hands with them and made a fuss over them, and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney just sat right down and cried. He smiles, embarrassed, and as well as the others, clear their throats. And then we started to find out about a lot of other people. Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance. Grubbel's here. See? (pointing) Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says. Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe. Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief! Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney And he gave you that five dollar raise. Yeah! Wasn't that swell! (laughing) Med. shot: Around He steps forward. Why, Bert, feel slighted. I'd like to join but nobody asked me. Med. shot: Around and Well, I'm sorry, Mayor, but we voted that no politicians could join. Just the John Does of the neighborhood.

Med. shot: Around He looks over at hesitates a moment, and then speaks. Well, er, the reason we wanted to tell you this, Mr. Doe, was to give you an idea what you started. And from where I'm sitting, don't see any sense in your jumping off any building. No! No! Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

You ran right out the window there. And you ran out over the tops of buildings and roofs and everything for miles, and was chasing you. (laughing) And all the time you were running you kept growing bigger and bigger and biggerand pretty soon you were as big as you are now. You know grown up. And all the time kept asking myself, "What am chasing her for?" And didn't know. (laughing) Isn't that a hot one?

The man you marry has got to swim rivers for you! He's got to climb high mountains for you! He's got to slay dragons for you! He's got to perform wonderful deeds for you! Yes, sir!" enters and stands back of him, listening. And all the time, er, the guy up there, you know, with the book, me, just stood there nodding his head and he said, "Go to it, Pop, whack her one for me, because that's just the way feel about it, too." So he says, "Come on down here and whack her yourself." So came down and whacked you a good one, see? And then he whacked oneand whacked you another one, and we both started whacking you like . . .

What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out. (in an effort to disillusion him) Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek."

Camera pans over to It is still a phenomenal movement. The John Does, or the hoi polloi as you've heard people call them, have been laughed at and ridiculed but here they are, gay and happy, having traveled thousands of miles, their expenses paid by their neighbors, to come here to pay homage to their hero, John Doe. Camera pans over to And in these days of wars and bombings, it's a hopeful sign that a simple idea like this can sweep the country, an idea based on friendliness, on giving and not taking, on helping your neighbor and asking nothing in return. And if a thing like this can happen, don't let any of our grumbling friends tell you that humanity is falling apart.

Do you know what mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock! You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?

Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh? Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea. Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does! (snorting) Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!

Little Bennett's gotta be taken care of! Didn't tell you that everybody in this room would be taken care? My agreement with you gentlemen stands! I'm with you, but still think it's a very daring thing we're attempting! These are daring times, Mr. Barrington. We're coming to a new order of things.

We believe in what we're doing! You're the one that was paid the thirty pieces of silver! Have you forgotten that? Well, haven't! You're a fake, John Doe, and can prove it! You're the big hero that's supposed to jump off tall buildings and things! Do you remember? What do you suppose your precious John Does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it? That you were being paid to say so? You're lucky if they don't run you out of the country!
