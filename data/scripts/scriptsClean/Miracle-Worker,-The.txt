Written by William Gibson July 8th, 1961 We see three faces in lamplight, looking down. They have been through a long vigil and it shows in their tired eyes and disarranged clothing. One is a young gentlewoman with a sweet girlish face, the second is an elderly stethoscope at neck, thermometer in fingers; the third is a gruff gentleman in his forties with chin whis- kers, Shet11 live. closes her eyes. can tell you now, thought she wouldn't, I've brought up two of them, but this is my wife's first, she isn't battle-scarred yet.

We'll have your father run an editorial in his paper, the wonders of modern medicine, they don't know what they're curing even when they cure it. Men, men and their battle scars, we women will have to -- Helen, Helen Captain, Captain, will you come. (She screams) standing lamp in hand watching the doctor's buggy recede in the night. Suddenly from the house behind him comes a knifing scream. wheels, the scream comes again and the follows KELLER's run with the lamp across the yard. runs into the house and up the dark stairs. bursts into the bedroom where is screaming at the crib, her look intent on the baby and terrible.

She takes the lamp from him, moves it before the child's face. She can't seel Helen. Or hear. When screamed she didn't blink. Not an eyelash -- Helen. Heleni She can't hear youl His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's name; almost fainting presses her knuckles to her mouth, to stop her own cry. The stairs in the Keller House. In the foreground we see the bannisters, in the background the wall. shadow.of the erratic, staggering figure of 5 year old appears on the wall, moving slowly.

It appears to be a kind of maze, the sheets blowing in the wind; and staggering among them is the figure of the child, 5 years old, reach- ing out, struggling, buffeted by the damp, blowing sheets, towards the figure. lashes out, her face frightened, unknowing --- she pulls down a sheet, be- comes tangled in its folds, almost hysterical. In the comes rushing from the house -- to help her. There is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a we see 7 years old, reaching up into tree. At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha, 7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball and rips it down, shattering at her feet. coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face, blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and beyond her the other children watching. We see the lonely expanse of field with 0 a low grass sprouting up, in the is the Keller house perhaps. Going slowly across the field is the figure of the child Patty Duke. From in under comes following her. Scene will be out up until Now we are in leaf-dappled sunlight in the Keller yard, on three kneeling children and an old dog around the pump. with jug on way to barn to get milk. The dog is a setter named and she is sleeping. Two of the children are Negroes, and The third child is quite unkempt, in body a vivacious little person with a fine head, attractive, but noticeably blind, one eye larger and protruding; her gestures are abrupt, insistent, lacking in human restraint, and her face never smiles. She is flanked by the other two, in a litter of 0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, hands thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the movements of their lips. The is on this; the dialogue is only background. First Itm gonna cut off this doe- torts leg, one, two, now then -- Why you cuttin' off that doctor's legs? I'm gonna give him a operation. Now I'm gonna cut off his arms, one, two. Now I'm gonna fix up She pushes hand away from her mouth. You stop that. Cut off his stomach, that's a good operation. No, I'm gonna cut off his head first, he got a bad cold. Ain't gonna be much of that doc- tor left to fix up, time you finish all them opera-- But is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she jerks them away. now fingers her own lips, moving them in imitation, but soundlessly.
