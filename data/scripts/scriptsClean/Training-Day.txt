"Training Day" -- by David Ayer by David Ayer August 18, 1999 - In a Simi Valley housing tract. It's dark. 4:59 Eyes glisten in the clock's shine, patiently watching the time. The hand that's been hovering over the clock drops. Silence. a fit young man, rolls over, throws an arm over his sleeping wife -- It's time. -- she's not there, just empty blankets. He sits up. his wife, in a rocking chair in the corner. Jake is surprised. How'd she sneak off? What are you doing up? She pulls back the blanket, she breast-feeds their infant daughter. Mooooo. She lavishes kisses on her baby. - is squirted on terry cloth. badge is rubbed against it in precise circles. - Jake, scrubbed, shaved, in T-shirt and jeans, studies the gleaming badge, snaps it in its case, clips it to his belt. He tosses a duffle on the counter. Searches through the police gear. Lisa taps a police baton on his shoulder. He takes it. Thanks. Wrong day to forget stuff. He shoves it in the bag. Zips it. She go back to sleep? Mmm-hmm. Ate like a pig. She grabs a pack of English muffins. Want some eggs for the road? gotta roll. Gotta beat the traffic. He grabs his duffle and pressed uniform off a chair. He kisses Lisa's cheek, her neck, her lips. Heads to the door. The Jake stops. Lisa answers. Hello? (beat, laughs) Hi! How nice, thank you. (beat, giggles) Yes, sir. He's right here. (to Jake) Jake. It's Alonzo. Jake takes the phone. Hello? (filtered) Hoyt? Yessir. (filtered) Meet the Lieutenant yesterday? Get the welcome aboard speech and all that? Yessir. (filtered) He's a good guy. Backs his boys. You all checked in? Your sheet signed off? Yessir. (filtered) You're not on the squad until sign it. And that depends on how you do today. Yessir. know. (filtered) On your way to roll call? Yessir. I'm not out the door right now. (filtered) Hoyt. Yessir? (filtered) Patrol fairies go to roll call.

Yessir. have a three eighty stainless with nine rounds of silver tips. (filtered) Bring it. Cuffs, too. We're gonna be in the office all day, but who knows, maybe we'll do some business. Told you, we're an aggressive unit. know, sir. That's why signed up. want to thank you for giving me the oppor -- -- Alonzo hangs up. Jake too. He stands there. Nervous. Grabs his stomach. What's wrong? Feel like it's football tryouts. Wish it was tomorrow so I'd already know if was on his squad or not. It's not tomorrow. It's today. And it's gonna work out. know it will. gotta relax. (snuggles against her) Don't have to show up until ten. She breaks the embrace -- sore breasts -- Ouch! Soon they'll be mine again. Jake chases them with cupped hands as she retreats, giggling. Their game. - Jake struts through the door, confidently looks around. in a flannel shirt, reading the paper in a booth. The gun leather tough vet is a hands-on, blue collar cop who can kick your ass with a look. Jake walks over. Slides in across. Alonzo's eyes will never leave his newspaper. Good morning, sir. young waitress pours Jake coffee, offers a menu. Jake waves it away. I'm okay, ma'am. Thank you. Have some chow before we hit the office. Go ahead. It's my dollar. No, thank you, sir. ate. Fine. Don't. Alonzo turns the page. long beat. Then: It's nice here. May read my paper? I'm sorry, sir... I'll get some food. No. You won't. You fucked that up. Please. I'm reading. Shut up. Jake does -- Jeeez, sorry. Pours a ton of sugar in his coffee. - The waitress pours refills. Alonzo reads. Jake fidgets. Where's the office, sir? Back at Division? No response. Gonna be nice not roasting all summer in a hot black and white. Alonzo sighs, carefully folds his paper. Glares at Jake. Tell me a story, Hoyt. My story? Not your story. story. You can't keep your mouth shut long enough to let me finish my paper. So tell me a story. don't think know any stories. Alonzo waves the paper in Jake's face. This is a newspaper. And know it's ninety percent bullshit but it's entertaining. That's why read it. Because it entertains me. If you won't let me read my paper, then entertain me with your bullshit. Tell me a story. real one or should make one up? (sighs) Where'd you do your probation? Van Nuys. Right. The Valley. No cute little anecdotes about your time on the mean streets of Van Nuys? Writing underage smoking cites at the shopping mall? Jake thinks. Bingo! He's got it. There was this stop. stop. Wow. Go on. We were on the mid-watch. We? You and...? Debbie. Debbie? The fuck's Debbie? My training officer. Debbie Maxwell -- -- You're was female? Yessir. She white? Black? White. She dyked out or she any good? She's pretty good. So you and Debbie are pullin' a mid-watch? Right. It's a real quiet night. yawner. We're rolling on Vanowen. I'm driving. And this Acura, just a beautiful car, comes out a side street. In excess. All over the median. So light it up and hit the wailer. Guy drives on like I'm invisible for ten blocks before he pulls over. Plates ran clean. approach. Debbie covers. Driver's this huge white guy. Can barely keep his eyes open. field test and arrest and I'm belting him in our unit. Debbie's tossing his car. She calls me to the vehicle and shows me a snubbed .38 and two shotguns, all loaded and locked. No shit? No shit. She calls our supervisor and keep searching. find five hundred grams of meth in the dash. Turns out our was on bail for distribution. He was on his way to smoke his ex-partner before trial. (proudly) We prevented a murder. Alonzo is astonished. ... amazing... Jake beams -- some story, huh? You're driving around the Valley with a fine bitch in your car for a year and the most entertaining story you got is a stop? Never hit her up for some Code in the back seat? have a wife. You also have a dick. Alonzo shakes his head in disgust. Jake is crushed. Let's go. Alonzo tosses a twenty on the table. his heavy wedding band we: - Jake and Alonzo crossing. Alonzo sizes Jake up, smirks at his dorky running shoes. You look, walk and talk like a cop. Grow your hair out. Alonzo stops at: narc-machine supreme. tired, candy blue 1978 Monte Carlo with mismatched rims, curb feelers, window tint. Gimme that menu. Jake pulls a Chinese menu from under the wiper. Hands it to Alonzo, who folds and pockets it. Get in. S'un1ocked. Jake's turn to smirk as he climbs in. - - Jake buries his shoes in beer cans and coffee cups. He notes a car seat in back. Alonzo twists a screwdriver in the shattered ignition, pumps the hell out of the gas. After forever, the -- This is a piece'a shit. Don't worry. My baby puts out when she has to. Alonzo rubs the dash lovingly and backs out. Where's the office? You're in it. Jake reacts. Then smiles -- This is kind'a cool. Rover's in the glove box. Wanna ten-eight us? Yessir. Shitcan the sirs. I'm not your domestic violence awareness instructor. Jake takes a Motorola radio from the glove box. What's our Nora fifteen. (into Motorola) Nora fifteen, ten-eight. Nora fifteen, ten-twenty. Jake checks the street signs -- Virgil and Raymond. Before he can tell Dispatch, Alonzo snatches the Motorola. (into rover) Nora fifteen, South on Rampart at 6th. Ten four. Alonzo out of the lot, tosses Jake the rover. Bad guys are listening. Don't trust the radios. Never let anyone know where you're really at. Ever. Jake nods and smiles -- makes sense. - - Heading South on Alvarado, passing MacArthur Park. It could be San Salvador or Guatemala City. Jake is mesmerized by the crowds. This looks like the Third World. It's my world. Alonzo lights a smoke. Settles in his seat. Today's a training day. Gonna show you around, give you a feel for the business. have thirty- eight cases pending trial. have sixty-three active investigations. There's another three hundred and fifty cases on the log can't clear. I'm supervising five officers. That's five different personalities, five different sets of problems. You, Officer Hoyt, if you got the guts to succeed, will be number six. don't have time to baby-sit or hold hands. You have one day to show me who you are and what you can or cannot handle. You can't hack narcotics, feel free to work a pussy desk pinching check kiters. Hear me, Officer Hoyt? hear you. Good. Gonna show you reality. Think you can handle it? Yeah. Why you wanna be a narc? want to serve my community by ridding it of dangerous drugs. Alonzo gives him a look -- Don't b.s. me. wanna make detective. The boy is ambitious. Alonzo likes that. Stick with me and you will. If you can unlearn the bullshit they've filled your head with. You gonna be passing out baseball cards and carrying old ladies' groceries like the rest of the newfucks Washington's flooded the streets with? Sergeant, I'll do anything you want me to do. Stand by, because narcotics ain't about staying in the car and looking good. bet you write great paper, Hoyt. (before Jake can answer) You do. checked it out. Cover your area, cover your ass, but not necessarily in that order, right? Right. Are you going to teach me that old school hard-charging beat up everything that moves Rodney King shit? That's not police work either. We're the new breed. We use this... (taps his head) This is our tool. Alonzo stops at a light. shiny new police cruiser pulls alongside. The driver sips a Big Gulp, his female partner writes a report. They look more like co-eds than cops. Jake eyes the driver. Who gives him a smile. Then Alonzo looks at the driver. When their eyes meet, the Driver looks away, intimidated, and makes a right turn. Alonzo grins at Jake, his point underscored. How long you been married? year. Gotta kid, right? (smiles) nine-month-old girl. got four kids. All boys. You want a son, lemme know. I'll do your old lady up. can't miss. Jake angers, though he knows he is being tested. Let's not talk about my family. It's cool. can respect that. I'm married. have my queen, too. remember what it's like to have a pretty young bride. Bet you still fuck her face-to-face. (clenched teeth) Can we not talk about my wife? Kick back, kid... You're so in love it's comin' out your eyes. The day you bring the old lady to the office is the day you don't go home. If you don't hide your love deep inside, the maggots are gonna find it and chew on it. Jake realizes Alonzo is right. Alonzo hands him a card. That's our Chaplain, Lieutenant Hayes. Give him a call. Invite him and his wife over for dinner. He's a good guy and no dumbshit. You and your woman need any kind'a help, call him. I'm serious. Jake takes the card. Kind of smiles. Thanks. will. They cruise a beat. Who's Mr. Clean? Alonzo nails him with surprised look. Where the hell you hear that? From a Van Nuys Robbery Detective. Told me to ask you that. (smiles, shakes his head) Asshole. Alonzo pulls onto a street of dense apartments. Parks along the curb. What's here? Transactions... See the Salvatrucha one-cut on the fence, trying not to look like he's slangin'? Jake looks, sees a young, bald cholo, Neto, just hanging out. That's Neto. Works for me. Informant? got eyes everywhere. He gets to peddle reefer, make a little cash for the family. get a heads up when shit goes down. The barrio on-line. And you trust him? Fuckin' right trust him. Sprung his mom from detention. Alonzo watches his mirror, perks up. Here we go. - new Beetle pulls onto the street, moving slow. The passes the G-Ride. Jake glimpses three people inside, two guys in front, a girl in back. Hipster university students. Shit's going down. The stops. Neto looks around, crosses to the driver's window, a drink cup in hand. Neto plucks a foil pack from the cup. Trades it for the driver's ten. Neto walks away. See the hand-to-hand? saw it. The drives off, fast. Alonzo pulls out. Follows it. When was your last felony stop? Couple weeks ago. You need practice. They look like college kids. They need a lesson. want these hemorrhoids grabbing glass. got front. You got back. Alonzo pulls his gun. Jake reaches for the Motorola. Stay off the rover. Jake puts it away, pulls his gun. Alonzo stomps the gas. The G-Ride The is at the corner, about to turn -- -- Alonzo slaloms to a stop, blocking its path. His pistol aimed through Jake's window at the Police! Lemme see your hands! Jake draws a bead on the girl in back. Police officers! Your hands! The kids gawk at the two narcs for a stunned beat. Don't look at us! Look straight ahead! Driver and right front passenger! Palms on the windshield! You in the back! Palms on the side window! Look straight ahead! Driver! Use your left hand, put the vehicle in park. The Driver is mortified because: ... it's a stickshift... Shut up, dickhead! I'll shoot your face off! Take the keys out of the ignition. Throw 'em out the window! The Driver does, quickly, as Alonzo jumps from the car charges the Driver, shoves the gun in his face. These are just scared kids. The girl tries not to cry. Fork it over, smartman. What, sir? Alonzo grabs his ear, tugs violently. The fuckin' marijuana just watched you purchase! The Driver hands over the foil pack. I'm very sorry, sir. didn't know he was bringing me here. Shut up, dumbass. You're here now! Gimme that pipe! There's a pot pipe on the floor mat. The picks it up. Reluctantly hands it to Alonzo. My mom gave me that pipe. What else you got? Cigarettes...? Gimme those too. He gives him a squished packed of Marlboro reds. The girl lowers her hands -- bad move. Control your suspect, Hoyt! Miss! Palms on the glass! Alonzo sees her lip quiver. Cry and slap the eyes outta your face! Back to the Driver. You aware this is a gang neighborhood? That gives him pause -- no kidding -- Alonzo grabs his ear again, shakes. see you here again, take your car. You can walk home while your girlfriend pulls a homeboy train... Hear me, reefer addict? Yes, sir. Thank you for your cooperation -- Safe your iron. Jake holsters his gun. Follows Alonzo to the G-Ride. The kids trade shell-shocked looks, grabbing glass. Then lower their hands. Alonzo and Jake climb in. As they drive away, the gir1 nails Jake with a look of revulsion. Jake reacts. - - Alonzo laughing. Jake didn't like what happened. It shows. Was that training? How to roust students for dime bags? They have no business being here. Sooner or later that little smart- ass white boy college puke is gonna get jacked. saved his life. Taught him a real lesson. Sure did, buy your shit on campus. (beat) like your moves. Someone trained you well. Jake smiles to himself. Alonzo opens the foil, sniffs -- Shitty dime. Check it out. -- hands it to Jake. Who takes out a bud. See the small hairs? The undeveloped seeds. How it's all stems? Jake nods. It was picked immature. See how flat it is? Classic brick-pack Mexican. See how brittle it is? It's not bud season. It's from last year. Jake is amazed. Alonzo snatches the bud, crumbles it in the pipe, tosses aside seeds. To be truly effective, a narcotics detective must know and love narcotics. good narcotics detective should have narcotics in his blood. You going to smoke that? Alonzo smiles devilishly, offers Jake the pipe. You are. Hell if am. What? You a Mormon? Jesus freak? No. I'm not losing my job. (re: the pipe) This is your job. can't do it. This isn't some kind of test. Take a fuckin' hit. became a cop to keep people from using that poison. (laughs) This ain't a review board. We ain't doing rails. Just leafy green bud. Jake stands firm, shaking his head. Alonzo stops in the middle of the street, pulls his gun, jams it in Jake's ear. behind them If was a dealer, you'd be dead. Turn shit down on the street and the Chief hands your wife a crisply folded flag. Jake stares stubbornly at Alonzo. Alonzo pockets the gun. Lights the lighter. And takes a huge hit, blows smoke in Jake's face. don't want you in my unit. Not even my division. Go back to Valley. Get the fuck out of my car. staring contest. Jake decides to play the game. ... Okay... He takes the pipe, takes an absolutely huge hit -- Alright. That's how it's done, son. -- And is racked with a spasm of coughing. Betrayed by your virgin lungs. Jake takes another hit -- a passing driver watches -- blows the smoke in Alonzo's face. Alonzo laughs, resumes driving, takes a hit. They pass the pipe around a few times before Alonzo tosses it on the dash. It's cashed. They cruise in a strange otherworldly silence. Jake is clearly messed up, his head lolls from side to side. Shit, you took some mansized hits. You gonna be okay? When's the last time you smoked out? ... Twelfth grade... Left that out of your service jacket. Knew you had secrets, everyone does. Didn't know you dig dusters. What are dusters? You know, dusted bud. Dippers? C'mon, dipped in Primos. Sherm, Kool, P-dog, Angel dust... Didn't you smell it? Taste it? (horrified) ... I've never done it... Now you have. Remember the smell for next time. Think I'd inhale that shit? Jake is scared as hell, pale, sweaty. Oh, no. No. No. No. Gonna kick the shit out of Neto. Motherfucker's lacing crappy bud to get that unsuspecting return client. Hell with his mom, I'm deporting the bitch. I'm gonna get piss tested. I'm gonna get fired. told you, Lieutenant's got our backs. We know a week before we piss. (panicking) Shit. How could you do this to me? Shit. Shit. Shit! Alonzo slams an elbow across Jake's throat. Fuckin' chill and ride the high. You're an adult. You chose to smoke. Live with your decisions. You cool? I'm cool. Besides, no one put a gun to your head. Jake shoots him a look. - well-tended craftsman on a steep hill of fixer-uppers in Echo Park. The G-Ride parks out front. Get your shit together. Alonzo and Jake cross to the door. The steepness of the hill is disorientating to Jake. Alonzo knocks. This is my Road Dog's pad. Wanna see what he thinks of you. What do say? You'll think of something stupid. Someone peeps through the peephole. tall, heavy man in a bathrobe with long, grey hair answers. This is old before his time, a little sick. Happy to see Alonzo. Hey, brother, get your ass in here. - Roger and Alonzo hug. Did wake you? No. C'mon in. Please have a seat. Alonzo and Jake sit in big chairs. Three beepers, three cell phones on the coffee table. Roger sits, takes a bottle of whisky, three tumblers from a liquor cart. Pours booze. Jake looks around at the modest traditional furniture. The Hummel figurines. Photos on the wall. Alright. Time to get my swerve on. Roger gives Alonzo a concerned look. Heard you had a beef in Vegas. I'm cool. People talk shit. You know got your back. know. Thanks. They clink glasses, chug booze. Jake doesn't. He stares into the liquid, enraptured by its smoky patterns. C'mon. Be polite. Jake takes his tumbler, sniffs, sips. Winces. Roger runs a finger up Jake's crew-cut. Jake recoils. Went and got yourself a daisy- fresh scuzz-headed rookie. Roger leans back in the couch. Jake is looking around the room again. Roger checks it. Dials a cell phone. Alonzo gesturing for Jake to drink. He almost empties his glass. Wassup? (beat) Collect first. Step to that cat with something to flash. He'll lay you down. (beat) Righteous. Later, dude. Roger hangs up. Studies Jake. Jesus, Alonzo. He's high as a motherfucker. The hell you give him? Alonzo tosses the foil pack on the table. Roger takes it, smells the and shakes his head. Where'd you grow up? North Hollywood. What's your last name? Hoyt. (it clicks) You play strong safety for North Hollywood High? Yessir. How'd you know? follow all the good players. His He checks it, sighs. Dials a cell phone. It's me. Whassup? (beat) Can't do a thing for you. Your mess. You clean it up. Don't be callin' me. He hangs up. Freshens the drinks. (to Jake) Here's a joke, boy. One day this man walks out of his house to go to work. He sees this snail on his porch. So he picks it up and chucks it over his roof, into the back yard. Snail bounces off a rock, cracks its shell all to shit, and lands in the grass. Snail lies there dying. Roger checks and ignores it. But it doesn't die. It eats some grass. Slowly heals. Grows a new shell. And after a while it can crawl again. One day the snail up and heads back to the front of the house. Finally, after a year, the little guy crawls back on the porch. Right then, the man walks out to go to work and sees this snail again. So he says to it, 'What the fuck's your problem?' Jake stares at Roger a beat. Then starts laughing. Really laughing. Maybe too much. He wipes his eyes. That's messed up. That wasn't funny. Then why are you cackling like a jackal? dunno. Figure that joke out and you'll figure the streets out. Don't listen to him. There's nothing to figure out. The street's nothing more than senseless bullshit. Uh-uh. got 'em figured out. You got the streets figured out? Yeah. It's all smiles and cries. Give up. You're too high, space captain. Hold on -- smiles and cries. hear you. You gotta control your smiles and cries. No one can take them away so... they're all we really have. Roger and Alonzo trade looks -- sharp kid. Alonzo pats Jake's shoulder. To Roger: Think this greenhorn can handle undercover? Roger scrutinizes Jake a beat. Smiles and nods: yes. You were just like him. (laughs) Fuck you. Same silly-ass look and everything. Saving the fuckin' world. That lasted a week. Alonzo stands, shakes with Roger. Brother, gotta get back in my office. Thanks for the snort, dog. What're you up to today? Roger gestures at the phones and beepers. Think get out of the house? Roger shakes with Jake. Take care, Hoyt. You're gonna do okay. - - South on Rampart. Jake senses he passed a test. Alonzo smiling at him. What? He liked you. Who is he? One of your snitches? He's no snitch. He's a good man to know. C'mon, let's find some action in Niggertown. (off Jake's look) N-wordtown. What are you, Hoyt? You ain't pure whiteboy. You mixed? Italian, Irish and Mexican. No shit? You're all fucked up. How's the Espanol? Mas o menos. Work on it. People'll be plotting the worst kind of shit behind your back. Alonzo parks in front of a liquor store. - Alonzo crosses to the G-ride with a sixer of beer -- - - -- Climbs in. Sees Jakes's eyes are closed. C'mon, man. Open your eyes. You'll make it worse. Nothing. Sit your ass up. Hoyt! Jake locks bleary red eyes on Alonzo, jokingly: Who're you? The fuckin' zig-zag man. Cool. I'm a cop. You're a little bitty boot. Alonzo cracks beers for him and Jake. C'mon. It helps. Believe me. Jake takes one. Swigs. Alonzo lights a smoke, pulls onto Normandie. Does a doubletake. Oh, damn! Jake looking around wildly. Oh, shit! What? What? What? Relax. See that savory Mexican mama? beautiful Mexican woman pushing a baby carriage. her in luscious Jake stares, mouth open. Alonzo points out more beautiful Latinas gracing the sidewalks. Mmmm-mmmm. The brown woman is the fine woman. Give her ten more babies to push around. Thick and tasty. Love to get up in that... Your old lady white? Fuckin' Nordic cheerleader, right? Wrong. She's Chicana. Light- skinned. like my meat dark. C'mon, pound that beer. Have another. Gives you ballast. Alonzo tosses his empty out the window. Jake too. Alonzo cracks two fresh beers -- Jake takes one, drops it, soaking his leg. Dumbass. Don't spill it. You gotta learn how to party. I'm fine. You gotta be able to handle a high. It's a necessary job skill. I'm not kidding. It's an alcohol world down here. You gotta be able to hang. To get fucked up and talk shit with sketchy sociopathic dumbasses and not pass out and get your shoes stolen. I'm fine. Just a little dizzy. But Jake looks decidedly green. He sips beer. mightily. Alonzo brakes, flings open Jake's door. Not in my car! Jake leans out, vomits onto the street. He hangs there a beat, dry heaving. Okay, okay. Well's dry, kid. He yanks Jake in by the collar. Keeps driving. Sorry. Wipe your chin. Jake does, rinses his mouth with beer, spits out the window. I'm cool now. Had to unload the groceries. He leans his head on the window pillar. Jakes's eye absorb the street's tableau of unworldly gliding by. Palm trees and sunshine. Paradise and hell in one. His lids begin to drift shut. Then Jake sees a flash of movement in an alley. Suddenly alert, he paws at the doorhandle. Activity on the right? Stop the car! Siddown, Hoyt. Everything's fine. Stop the fucking car! C'mon, relax. You're trippin' -- Jake grabs the gearshift, throws it in reverse. The transmission tires The engine stalls. Jake is out like a shot -- - - -- He dodges an oncoming car. Get the fuck back here! Jake into the alley. Alonzo pulling to the curb. Dumb-ass kid. Running like a deer. He enters the alley. Sees a book bag on the ground -- dumpster ahead. Jake rounds it. Fast. devastatingly beautiful Latina pinned against the wall by a tall Her nose dots blood on her uniform blouse. The Crackhead hauls back to smack her. Jake Charging. Police officer! You're under arrest! The Crackhead punches Jake's throat. Stops him cold. Jake realizes how huge this guy is. Gulp. Gonna fuck you too, cop. dives from the shadows and tackles Jake. Both go down hard. Crackhead #1 stomps Jake's head. Jake gets his arm around Crackhead #2's neck, squeezes -- the forbidden choke hold. Alonzo enters the alley. And just stands there, watching. Jake rides out Crackhead #I's vicious kicks as Crackhead #2 convulses from hypoxia. And finally goes limp. Jake lets go, sweeps Crackhead #I's legs out from under him and hops to his feet. Crackhead #1 stands too. The Schoolgirl looks on, stunned. #1 You're ass is doomed. Jake growls, snatches him up like a rag doll, spins him, slams him hard. In a flash, Jake twists him into a pretzel, drops a knee on his neck, grinds his head into the asphalt. Clicks on the cuffs. #1 We didn't do shit. Bitch is crazy and shit. Crackhead #2 coming to, starting to stand. Jake crosses to him, pins his head with his knee. Slips a pair of flexicuffs from his sock, zips them on the man's wrists. #2 Man, you fuckin' up, slick. Homegirl tradin' her ass for cookies. Shut the fuck up, sir! Smiling, impressed by his raw skill. Thanks for the help. Should'a shot 'em. Jake crosses to the Schoolgirl. We're police officers. You okay? You hurt? (to the Crackheads, shaken but tough) You fucked up! My cousins are from White Fence. They're gonna blast you fools! Pinchi mayates! Miss! Relax! Are you okay? What? No. No, I'm not okay. Lookit my nose... My mom's gonna trip out. Alonzo gingerly examines her nose. Honey, it's just a nosebleed. Put ice on it. Don't be walkin' around here alone. Tell your cousins to get your back. You know what those pieces'a shit were gonna do. Probably got Why aren't you in school? was going to a ditch party. You almost became a ditch party. Go home. Go home. Now. She grabs her book bag and gets out of there. gotta get her statement. Unhook em'. We're not racking up arrests. (shocked) Kick 'em loose? No. Get some shots in first. have a punching bag at home. want them off the street. Alonzo squats by Crackhead #1. Searches him. Hear that, bro? My dog, here, wants to lock you up. Been to the bootyhouse? Grabbin' ankles for the big boys? #1 Suck my dick, bitch. know people. Kick back, who's-who. Alonzo finds rocks in one sock. Some twenties in the other. He pockets the cash and crack. Searches Crackhead #2. Where's your horn? #2 Ain't got no horn. Alonzo finds a glass pipe. So what's this, chief? Gonna make you eat it. Instead, he grinds it underfoot. Ya'll lucky got pressing business today -- You, stand up. Alonzo hauls Crackhead #1 to his feet. Unlocks the cuffs, tosses them to Jake. Crackhead #2 strains against the flexicuffs. (to Crackhead #2) You get to keep those. He steers Crackhead #1 to a wall -- cocks his fist. Ain't the first honey ya'll pinned to a wall, huh? Close your eyes. Crackhead does. Alonzo knees his groin -- oof! -- He falls to the ground, whimpers in the fetal position. Next time cut your dick off and shove it up your ass. (pats Jake's back, winks) I'll leave you three alone. Gonna grab some beer. Alonzo exits the alley. Jake watches Crackhead #1 whimper, Crackhead #2 writhe in the gutter. It's futi1e to beat these men. Jake takes pity, walks away. #2 Pussy motherfucker. Gonna see your ass again. Gonna fuck you up, bitch. Won't see shit coming. Creep like a ninja and crack your head open. Blow your house up. Punk-ass white boy. Now you in my world, motherfucker. Jake stops and turns around. He stoops to pick up a pink Hello Kitty change purse. The Schoolgirl's bus pass and her freshman from Immaculate Heart High School. Jake glares at the Crackheads. You assholes! She's fifteen! #2 (grins) She all woman. Tax that ass for days. Man! Jake could kick his brains out. Somehow, he turns and walks away. - - Jake steams. Alonzo offers a beer from a new sixer. Jake refuses. Alonzo counts and pockets the money he took. Notes Jake's stare. Wanna book sixty bucks? Where're the suspects? (ice) You let them go. Get over it. You wanna go runnin' and gunnin', stay in patrol. This is Investigations. Leave the garbage for the garbage men. We're professional anglers. We reel in the big ones. Should'a dished out some shoe leather. You'd have a big 'ol smile on your face. get my shits and grins booking bad guys, not beating them. Man... The fuck you doing running alone into an alley full'a cracked-out monkey-strong motherfuckers? Those hemorrhoids wouldta killed you without mercy or hesitation. That's why they belong in prison. They lost their money, their rock, got beat down and now the eses from White Fence are gonna smoke 'em. Jesus, what more do you want? Justice. Is that not justice? That's street justice. What's wrong with street justice? Let the animals wipe themselves out, right? If only they would. But it don't work like that. They wipe out the good folks. Notice how it's always school kids, mommies and ass-bustin' family men catching stray slugs in their noodles. You protect the sheep by catching the wolves. It takes a wolf to catch a wolf. What? You protect -- heard you. Whatever. beat. When do you lock anyone up? Seems like you're too busy keeping people out. Bad mistake. Alonzo slaps him. Glares at him. Shut up, boot! Nothin' but shit 'tween your ears. They build prisons cause'a me! Judges have handed out fifteen thousand man years of incarceration time based on my investigations. My record speaks for itself. How many felons have you collared? Dickhead. Now that it's clear who's the boss, they drive in tense silence for a long beat. Alonzo digs in his pocket -- Here... -- hands Jake the rocks he found. beat. I'm not smoking crack. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Toss 'em in the glove box. Jake does, sees several more rocks under some papers. Comes in handy. Like a debit card. (offers Jake a beer) You earned it. C'mon. Jake refuses. No matter what say, want you to know, you did the right thing. Reminds me of when could chase down anyone and fuck them up. You're a good cop. You got fire. That was some amazing shit back there. Thanks. That the choke hold saw you applying? Isn't that a big no-no, procedure-boy? Well... was getting my ass kicked. You did what you had to do. Alonzo gives Jake a beer and grins at him like a proud dad. You got a magic eye, Hoyt. You have a magic fucking eye. Up your street and you'll do some damage, crime fighter. They clink cans. Jake smiles. - The G-Ride rolls through the intersection. If you don't know the neighborhood, stay the hell out. - - The area fills Alonzo's eyes with memories. This is Southwest Div. Did my probation here. Learned a lot here. Good things. Bad things. Kicked some ass. Had my ass kicked. Back in the days. Yeah, back in the days. Today's my date of employment. Know how long been a cop? (as Jake shakes his head) Thirteen years. Seven more and cash outta the game. No shit. Happy anniversary. Jake holds out his hand. Alonzo shakes it. Kills his beer, cracks another. Thanks. Thirteen's an unlucky number but the seven to go cancel it out. Alonzo turns on Adams. He reaches over, digs in the glove box. Pulls out a photograph and hands it to Jake. - spit-and-polish, young cop in crisp blues, white gloves, holding his Beretta at inspection arms. Jake looks at the photo, then at Alonzo. Realizing: You're Mr. Clean. had a few misconceptions when started out. (points out a house) On the left. See that house? Dude named Spooky lived there. Mean old vato loco. Mexican Mafia. No one fucked with Spooky. Even got respect from the cops. We'd keep an eye on his house. You like dogs? Gotta six-year-old Rottweiler. Not too bright, but can trust him with my kid. Rotties are good dogs. Dobermans are better. Spooky raised Dobermans. On my second week of patrol, when was not knowin' shit, we roll by Spooky's one night. observe this old, black fool, named Too Fine, all drunk, beating the shit out of this female Doberman. Beautiful dog, seven months old. Too Fine's whoopin' her with a garden hose. This dog's just crying, shaking. grew up with Dobermans. was pissed. tell my 'I'm gonna take him.' And my is like: 'No, no. It's cool.' He fuckin' waves to Too Fine and this motherfucker smiles and waves back and keeps hitting the dog. Thought lost my damn mind. Tells me Spooky gave him twenty bucks to beat the shit out of it. My this good 'ol boy, looks me in the eye and says: 'Teaches 'em to hate niggers.' Almost quit right there. Almost got out of the fuckin' black and white and took the bus home. Jake looks at Alonzo. That's fucked up. That's one of the most fucked up things ever heard. Just remembered that. Every time I'd seen it all, the street'd show me something even more fucked up. know you didn't see no shit like that in the Valley. No, haven't. Jake takes a last look at the photograph of young Alonzo and replaces it in the glove box. Alonzo enters an alley cutting through several blocks. Double-nickel Crips control shit here. They come up hard. Come in here running undercover shit and get made as a narc, the O.G.s'll booty-bust you then some thirteen- year-old wannabe'll curbstone you. Feed your dead ass to a pit bull. Youngins here fight for the right to dump a cop. Everyone wants a name. That really happen? No, Hoyt, I'm pullin' your dick. Anything can happen. It's loony tunes here. Keep an eye out for rock stars. Alonzo pulls on a side street where a young gangster, is ready to serve them. There's one. Don't let him see your face. And don't let anyone run up on us with a shotgun. Alonzo pulls out a twenty, stops near Peanut, who crosses to his window. What you want, homie? (flashes twenty) Twenty. Gimme a big-ass chip. Peanut takes a rock from his pocket, gives it to Alonzo, reaches for the twenty -- Alonzo cuffs him to the steering wheel -- Let's take a ride, asshole. -- Stomps the gas, Peanut runs to keep up. Alonzo stops at the end of the alley. You from double nickel? Ain't from shit. Again: Where you from? My mom. Your mom? From her ass? You a butt baby? Fuck you -- -- Alonzo races in reverse down the alley. Peanut is yanked off his feet. His legs drag in the dirt. Alonzo stops, lights a squished Marlboro. He has Peanut's attention. What do they call you? Peanut. You in double nickel, Peanut? Peanut nods. See, respect me, respect you. Talk shit, fuck you up. Ah'ite, homie. Ah'ite. Who's the boss? You. No, dumbass. Who you slangin' for? Peanut clams up. Alonzo grabs the gearshift. Gimme a name or your hand. Choose now. Peanut stares at his hand, flexes it. Alonzo revs the engine. Mr. Mighty. Alonzo shoves forty bucks in Peanut's hand, unlocks him -- Back to work, poo-butt. -- and drives away. Peanut flips him off. - - Jake adds Peanut's rock to the glovebox. He was just a kid. Kids or not, gotta make 'em sing. Who's Mr. Mighty? Let's get him. Nope... can't catch that fish. Why not? Lives in the unincorporated part of Lynwood. We don't wanna deal with County Sheriffs. Fuck that headache. Wastin' our time here. Let's head East. - - The G-Ride cruising through an even worse area. Alonzo scans the urban wasteland for prey. Sees a gaunt on a corner. Hands Jake a twenty. Your turn. What do say? Adlib, dumbfuck. He pulls over. The Dealer crosses to Jake. What you want, homie? Crack. Twenty dollars' worth. Fuck you, rookie. He quickly walks away. Alonzo smiles. Fetch, boy. Fetch. Jake bolts from the car. - - - walking. He sees Jake, starts running. Jake gaining, tackles him. Gets the Dealer in a compliance hold and cuffs him. Alonzo pulls up, sees Jake grinning. Love doing that, huh? (searches Dealer) Who you work for, fuckstain? Can't work. I'm on disability. Bullshit. You crackin'. Jake finishes searching. No rocks? No rocks. (laughing) Aw, dang. See? Ya'll ain't got shit. The man comin' up short again. Alonzo exits the car. Glares. never come up short, fool. (to Dealer) Open your mouth. The Dealer does. Sensing to not play with Alonzo. Lift your tongue. He does. See. ain't be gottin' shit. Gimme a pen. Jakes does. Alonzo grabs the Dealer's neck. Forces the pen in his mouth. Down his throat. He gags -- Urgh! Vomits. Motherfucker! Jake is stunned. Alonzo inspects the spattered sidewalk. Sees Saran-wrapped rocks. Lookie those. That's corn. That's Jimmy crack corn... One, two, three, four, five... six. How'd you swallow that shit without water? Fuckin' bullshit! Fuck you, civil rights violatin' motherfuckers. Alonzo slaps him. Gonna act like a man or a bitch?! Got you cold. Gimme a name and stay on the streets. The Dealer mulls it over. He in County. Who? Sandman. He's shot callin'. Unhook him, Hoyt. Jake unlocks the cuffs. Alonzo steps over the vomit. And collect the evidence. Fuck you. You're learning. - - Jake keeps looking at Alonzo, half impressed, half appalled. What? You don't give a fuck. Alonzo grins, dials a cell phone. Afternoon, Bob. It's Alonzo, Rampart Narcs. (beat) Good, and you? (beat) Great. (beat) Yeah, that's right. made it. The big one three. (beat; laughs) 'Course I'm on the street. Hey, partner, got your gang book? (beat) Okay, need a res. Alias is Sandman. If he's not in Ghetto Boys, try the Mobsters... might be in custody. (beat) No, I'll hold. (to Jake) Bob Ramirez. Intel coordinator for Seventy-Seventh Div Crash. (into phone) -- Yeah, Bob, still here. Shoot. Alonzo jots the information on a notepad. Okay... Thank you, sir. That's gonna do it. Have a good one. Alonzo hangs up. We go after the Sandman? We go after the Sandman. Jake smiles. - Graffiti on a wall: -- The G-Ride glides and The G-Ride parks in front of a house. Alonzo and Jake exit. Alonzo pops the trunk. Inside is a microwave box, toaster, a boombox, a Gonna open a Circuit City? It's unclaimed shit from property. pass it out to informants, victims, witnesses. Help their families out. Alonzo fishes out an assault vest, tosses it to Jake and dons an windbreaker, across the back. Intel says his mom's in the residence with two female juveniles and a possible male juvenile. If he's not here, why are we here? Alonzo pulls a paper out of his pocket, unfolds it. We gotta serve this search warrant. It's the Chinese take-out menu Jake handed him earlier. We can't do that. Yes we can, supercop. Ding-ding, that's the schoolbell. He slams the trunk. Pulls his gun. They cross to the door. Get a real warrant. wanna get shit done. They step onto the porch. Take sides by the front door. Don't get me killed, new guy. He knocks on the security screen. Police! Search warrant! Silence. Alonzo knocks again. Nods at Jake. Open the door. Nothing. Then: Kevin ain't here. He up at the Honor Ranch. Please open the door or we kick it in! Ma'am?! The door is unlocked, opened. An attractive black stands on the other side of the security screen. Alonzo waves the menu. Search Warrant. Unlock the door and back away. She does, Alonzo snaps it open, rushes in, Jake follows. - - Jake and Alonzo swinging guns around the room. There's two scared toddlers in a play pen. The Woman on the couch, pissed. Stand up, ma'am. He searches the couch for a weapon. Anyone else in the house, ma'am? My nephew, Dimitri. He in the bedroom. The boy is ten. Cover her. Gonna clear the house. You can sit. Please keep your hands on your knees. Alonzo exits through a doorway into the kitchen. Kitchen's clear! We Alonzo moving through the bedrooms. Bedrooms're clear! Bringing out the kid! Alonzo marches Dimitri, 10, into the living room. The youngster trembles. S'okay, son, we're the good guys. Go sit on the couch with your aunt -- House is code-four. Gonna start my search. Alonzo exits. The Woman glares at Jake. wanna read the warrant. (reacts) My partner has it. She looks out the window at the empty street. Where's your back-up? Ma'am, please be quiet while we conduct our investigation. You got the gun, boss. (sotto) Crooked-ass motherfuckers. The kids stare at Jake like an occupying soldier. He crosses to Dimitri, smiles. Hey, little man. How's it going? Jake tries to shake. Dimitri crosses his arms, looks away. The Woman smirks. the of Alonzo tearing apart the bedrooms like a hurricane. Making a hell of a mess. The Woman stands. Ma'am. Stay seated. Who you be thinkin'? Comin' in like you pay the rent. Ma'am, sit down. Both ya'lls stink. Drinkin' all day. Gotta get liquored up to do business? Alonzo is suddenly quiet. Jake backs to the doorway, peeks around it. Sees a dresser with a mirror. Alonzo shoves something big down his raidjacket. Siddown. Gonna shoot me, boss? Kids, don't look. The drunk policeman gonna shoot me now. Alonzo enters, excited, grinning. Didn't find shit. Let's go -- Sorry about the inconvenience, ma'am. Thank you for your cooperation. He and Jake head for the door. wanna see the warrant. Here. He hands her the menu as they exit. - At the end of the block, three big buy popsicles from a Mexican vendor. The Woman bursts out of the house, screams at Jake and Alonzo as they climb in the G-Ride. Fuckin' jackers! You ain't no fuckin' police! Get the fuck back here with my money! She sees the gangsters. Why ya'll standin' there lookin' pretty?! Blast them fools! The gangsters trade looks. Start running towards -- Alonzo sees the gangsters. Tries the The engine won't catch. C'mon, baby. Don't do me like that. The gangsters getting closer. Fuckin' bitch! Start! Nothing. Alonzo piles out. Raises the hood, taps the carb with the butt of his gun. Start it! Jake twists the screwdriver. No dice. He sees a Glock pulled from a waistband. Alonzo tapping. Gun! Gun! Gun! Start it! Alonzo slams the hood. Climbs in. from the driveway. The armed gangster drops to one knee. The G-Ride tear-asses away in Glock's sights. a taillight. pierces the trunk -- - - -- the back seat -- the front seat -- the six pack -- and finally the dash. Jake reacting to beer spray. Alonzo rounds the corner, tosses the wounded cans out the window. Shit... Let's hit a liquor store. Jake fingers the hole in the dash. Gun! Gun! Gun! Jake startles, Alonzo laughing. First time you been shot at? (lies) No. Yeah, it is. That wasn't cool. That wasn't cool at all. What the fuck were you doing in there? Looking for narcotics activity. Scales. Baggies. Guns. Coke. Bud. Etcetera. Cash...? Say it, motherfucker. She was screaming about money. Bitch was talking shit. Trying to get us blasted by her homies. Jake's eyes fall to a brick-shaped bulge under Alonzo's raid jacket. What? dunno. I'm just a new guy. daisy-fresh scuzz-head boot. You tell me what. don't deny my shit stinks. will never deny that. So why do got the best arrest and conviction record in the county. Why? 'Cause don't handicap myself with bullshit. thought that bullshit served a purpose. You thought wrong. There's hemorrhoids walking free on the streets right now who've killed fuckin' three, four, five people. know it, they know it, every detective on payroll knows it. Why do these turds still float around? The rules. take down the duly deserving. I'm not locking up Mr. Nine-to-five, Mr. Family Provider. Jake shaking his head angrily. C'mon, communicate. What aren't you saying? Talk to me. beat. Then Jake fixes Alonzo with a stare. think... think you're a rogue cop. Alonzo laughs his ass off. Wipes his eyes, he laughs so hard. Fuckin' Hoyt, man. Know what? You're alright. You are alright. Jake gives him an "I'm not stupid" look. You're in a privileged position to learn a thing or two if you can keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. If you're serious about doing good out in the real world, this is the place to learn how. If this shit shakes you up, go back to Division and cry to the Watch Commander. He'll find you a nice job lighting flares and measuring wrecks. Decide now if you want to be a wolf or a sheep. If you want on my squad, I'll sign your card. Alonzo stops the car. Reaches over and opens Jake's door. If not, get out of my car. Jake looks at Alonzo, he turns away and reacts. They are parked in front of a police station, steps lead up to a pair of glass doors. Jake sits there a beat. He gives Alonzo a final look. Then gets out of the car. - - Jake stiffly marches up the steps. Then stops. And turns. Alonzo staring at him. Waiting for him to change his mind. beat. Jake shakes his head: no. Alonzo is gone. - Jake badges the elderly sergeant desk and is buzzed into the offices. - Jake stands just inside the door. Taking in station life. Station queens of all sorts. Overweight cops talk on the phones. Pension jockeys tap away at keyboards. This is about as far from the action as you can get. Jake looks at a sign over a door: Instead of crossing to it. Jake looks at his hands, dirty and scraped from fighting. Jake turns around and exits. - As Jake descends the steps, the G-Ride pulls up. The passenger door opens. Jake climbs in. Shuts the door. - - Alonzo holds out his hand. Solemn. Welcome to Narcotics, Officer Hoyt. Jake beams, shakes his hand. I'm going to do my best. You do and you'll run the unit someday. (a beat) You hungry? Let's code seven. - The G-Ride pulls onto a side street then winds its way through a maze of shabby streets. - - Jake nervously glances around one of the toughest parts of the city. strong point adorned with wrought iron and concertina wire. What are you doing? We'll be killed coming in here. Oh, you've heard about this neck of the woods? No man's land. (points) You got Broadway there, dividing the eastside-westside Hispanic gangs. And Adams Boulevard there is the only thing separating the Rolling Twenties Bloods from the Hoover Crips. They said never come in here with anything less than a platoon. (impressed) On top of that, area's an administrative nightmare. Four Division boundaries meet here. Rampart, Central, Southwest and Newton. That makes everything that happens here the other guy's problem. Jake is really uncomfortable. thought we were going to eat. Alonzo gives him a reassuring look and stops in front of a cul-de-sac of run down houses and apartments. He little kid runs out of the corner house. He eyes Alonzo then hops on his bike and rides into the cul-de-sac. beat. The little kid returns. Waves Alonzo into the cul-de- sac. Alonzo turns onto the dangerous dead-end, driving around a poorly parked van. That little kid's a lookout. Lots of eyes on us right now. Never come up in here without me. For your safety. I'm serious. Okay. Why do you have a golden pass? Because I'm square with 'em. But they know if the line is crossed, I'm leading the platoon in here. Alonzo parks in front of some apartments. Jake and Alonzo get out. An old woman sweeps her doorstep and glares at Jake. Buenas tardes, Dona Lucila. The old woman smiles, nods. Jake and Alonzo pass a long driveway as they cross to some stairs. At the far end of the driveway, gangsters work out and drink. One of them is benching over 300 pounds. Don't look at them. Alonzo and Jake climb the steps. See that dude benching? Yeah, Jesus. Exactly, you run into him; you pray. Real quick hands for a big guy. Used to make money boxing but he fucked that up. Alonzo knocks on a door. What's here? loving touch. Quien...? Policia, senorita. The door opens, there stands a ravishing Salvadoran in a housedress. She hugs Alonzo, plants a big kiss on him -- Hi, papi. -- then notices Jake and backs off. He's just my new guy. She holds out her hand. They shake. Hi. How are you? Good, thank you. Come in, come in. Welcome to my house. Alonzo enters, Jake follows. - The living room is filled with Salvadoran kitsch. 2- year-old boy on the couch watches cartoons. Alonzo motions for Jake to sit. You had a rough morning. Relax and let her hook you up. He disappears into the bedroom. Sara hands Jake the remote. Here. Take this. have cable. You watch what you want. This is your house. Don't be shy. She crosses to the kitchen. Sounds of Jake is about to change the channel. The kid gives him a look. He puts away the remote. Sara returns with a massive tray of food, chicken stew, beans, rice, salad, tortillas, the works. She sets the mouth-watering spread before Jake. This is El Salvador food. hope you like it. Thank you. This is great. I'm starving. She hangs a beat, eabarrassed. I'm sorry. have too... Jake knows. She runs off. - Sara hands Alonzo a beer. Alonzo lays back on the bed with a huge grin. She surveys him, smiles. Wow. That's something different. You're smiling. Wassup, woman? Lookin' good today. (unties his shoes) Well, happy man: you didn't say 'hi' to your son. He's been asking for you. Yeah, well... will. She removes his shoes, massages his feet. How's your wife? Why the fuck you comin' at me with all this shit? Don't you have a brain? I'm in a good fuckin' mood for the first time in who knows how the fuck long and you start talkin' shit. Man. Just shut the fuck up. Take that shit off and get your ass in bed. (crosses her arms, glares) I'm not a piece of something for you to bark at, mister. I'm sorry. Please get your ass in bed. gotta get back to work. She thinks it over. Slips off her dress -- Wow! This is because want to. Not because you tell me to. Whatever. - Jake dozes, his plate wiped clean, an arm around the little kid, still watching cartoons. Alonzo enters, invigorated, he kicks Jake's foot. Let's go. We're rollin'. Gotta meeting in fifteen. Jake stirs, stretches. Stands. Alonzo shows him the door. Go to the car. wanna thank her for the food. It was great. I'll tell her, don't worry. Jake tussles the kid's hair. See you later, little man. Jake exits. Alonzo picks up his son. Hugs him tight. Kisses him. Hey. How you been? Been good? Gettin' heavy, mister. Mama says you miss me. Sara watches from the bedroom doorway. Seeing Alonzo like this rips her apart more than anything he says. - - Near downtown. The noon sun high and bright. What about your queen? Sara's my princess. like her. She's a really cool lady. So are her two sisters. They look fuckin' good and they party. How'd you like to be in the middle of a bitch sandwich? Come to Vegas with us. No, thanks. get mine at home. You're missing out. should know. Her kid looks just like you. He's number five. Number six. Six kids. That's all? Or you holding royal court in a few more houses? I'm only aware of six. It's easy to make a baby -- -- And hard to take care of one. Fuck you, okay? No one's going hungry. Everyone gets plenty of what they need: toys, shoes, clothes. Love? Alonzo shoots a look at Jake. Let's not talk about my family. - great place for lunch and cocktails. Alonzo and Jake cross to the entrance. Alonzo, his raidjacket tucked underarm, hands Jake some Visine. Use it. Jake does. Alonzo opens the door. Who's here? Don't speak unless spoken to. - lunchtime business crowd dines in burgundy leather booths amidst a forest of wrought £ron. Alonzo leads Jake into: - - Empty. Save for the back table. Three scary 40ish bruisers in nice suits, share a pitcher of beer. Doug and Stan see Alonzo, react like they've seen a ghost. So Lou turns around, sees Alonzo. And quickly stands. It's tense. Like there could be a gunfight. Jake's hand creeps near his gun. Alonzo and Lou converge, trading serious questions and answers with their eyes. Jake watches Stan and Doug. They watch him. Alonzo and Lou grab hands grimly. (softly) don't know why I'm meeting you. don't talk to dead men. (smiles, winks) Ain't dead yet, you prick. They shake vigorously, smile big. Everyone relaxes. (claps his back) Fuckin' Alonzo. Heard you just tucked lucky number thirteen under your belt. Hey, man. Congratulations. Thanks, Lou. What, marked your calendar? Lou smiles, taps his temple. Doug and Stan shake with Alonzo. It's clear he makes them uncomfortable. Congratulations. Good to see you. Congratulations. You made it through another year of this madness. Who the fuck is Ricky Rookie? Alonzo grabs Jake's shoulder, pulls him into the huddle. This is Jake Hoyt, first day on the squad. Jake shakes Lou's hand. Sees an Captain's badge on his belt. Jake realizes these guys are police administrators. Jake, this is Lou Jacobs, interagency task-force coordinator. You ever have to talk to a fed, talk to this man first. He'll get your back. Pleased to meet you, sir. This is Stan Gursky, senior investigator for the County officer involved shooting team. Think about him before you pull a trigger, okay? Stan will rock your world if you make a bad call. (shaking with Stan) Pleased to meet you, sir. And this is Doug Marcab, Metro Burglary. Does high-dollar cases for the Poodle crowd. Your Van Gogh takes a trip. Doug'll find it. Pleased to meet you, sir. Lou takes Alonzo's arm. Have a seat, guy. Alonzo slides into the booth after Lou. (to Jake) Shoo, boy. Shoo. He points out the adjacent booth. Jake crosses, sits, his back to their table. Seems like a good kid. An attractive tall blonde waitress, brings a fresh pitcher of beer. Fuckin' elbow benders read my mind. Look's like you're way ahead of us. I'm always a step ahead of you guys. Julie smiles at Alonzo. There's the mystery man. Thought you gave up on us. What've you been up to? Been good. More bad than good, right? You know it. Mmmm-hmmm. You need to eat. Combo plate? No. I'm good. Toss the kid, there, a taco and a beer. Alonzo grabs the pitcher, starts pouring. Julie walks away. Why the long face, Doug? Feds seize your house or something? Chuckles from Lou and Stan. Fuck you, Alonzo. Doug had a bad day in court today -- Tell him what happened. You tell him, think it's so funny. He went to a sentencing hearing. On a three strikes case against a silk-suit catburglar type. Fuckwad pulled fifteen Encino burglaries. Spent twelve months trying to catch the suspect, a real slickster, gave up nothing. Captain rode my ass the entire time. What broke it? Luck. Caught in the act by a fuckin' patrolman. We had him. It was the prosecutor's first serial burglary case but he slam- dunked it from a stepladder. Clockwork trial. Jury deliberates half a day. Comes back guilty on ten out of eleven counts. The fuckbag was looking at a twenty- five mininum. Mininum. Bye-bye, toilet-licker. Sentencing was today -- -- Judge is female. Right. Female judge. Who? Landers. The stress-case brunette. know her. Sharp lady. Before this guy goes to the hearing, he gets a hold of some peanut butter and packs his ass crack with it. So there he is, standing tall before the bench to give his statement and he shoves his hand down his pants and comes out with a gob of fuckin' extra- chunky Jiff. Could'a heard a pin drop. Bailiffs wouldn't come near him. He looks the judge right in her eyes and licks his fingers clean. Holy shit. The judge, she screams. All these homeowners are there to read statements, they run out of screaming. Alonzo is breaking up. Stan and Lou, too. laughing too. Julie returns with a beer and a taco plate. And walks away with a flirty smile. No, wait, here's the punchline... Judge Landers, she says: (falsetto) Oh, this poor man's insane, he can't go to prison. (himself, grim) She ordered him to psychiatric. (floored) You are fucking kidding. She fell for it? Time she found out it was sandwich spread, the order was signed and he'd been transferred. Proceedings closed. Proceedings closed. Fucker'll do six months in the puzzle factory before they say he's normal and kick him loose. So a maggot gnaws on a wrinkleneck. Real or not, lock him up. He's repulsive not insane. Little kids eat their own shit. Not my kids, Lou. It's called coprolagnia. People do it for sex kicks. Bullshit. How do you know? Had a case when worked vice. Only in America. If the asshole's clever enough to play the system like that, say he earned his freedom. see him on the street, I'm gonna fuckin' do him. Take his bullets, Stan. Laughs. Alonzo pours a fresh round. Hey, listen to this, my new guy, right? Been showing him around town. Scored some reefer for him to smoke. But he wouldn't. So run through the whole bit, the gun to the head. Everything. 'Okay,' he says. light up and it stinks like burnt rubber, right? pass it to him anyway. The detectives grin knowingly. You're an asshole. Kid's gotta learn. He sucks the shit down. Showing me he can hang. We're in MacArthur Park and he starts screaming and jumps out of the fuckin' car. And runs down the street. Omigod. thought he lost it. The detectives are hooked. So is... Listening, sipping beer. So chase him down this alley and, holy shit, he's jamming two huge crackheads and there's this pretty girl with a bloody nose. Kid stopped a rape. No shit. No shit. Kid's got a magic eye. That's what told him. Kid's a prince. Jake beams with beer-buzzed pride. His first day on the squad and know what he tells me? (pathetic voice) 'You're a rogue cop.' Roars of laughter from the Detectives. Lou refills beers, holds up his glass for a toast. Okay. Okay, ladies... Here's to the craziest, most bounce back, nine lives cop to darken the streets of this fine city. Congratulations for -- ahem -- honorably completing thirteen years in the most fickle job a man could be married to. Glasses clink. The men drink. Lou turns to Alonzo, quiet, serious. You should be at Division hiding under a desk. Best way to fix a problem is to look it in the eye. I'm not the problem. He turns, sees it's a serious pow-wow. Overhears: Heard you had an expensive weekend in Vegas. How'd you fuck up so bad? How could know? Vegas ain't my town. I'm not omniscient. You should hop a jet outta here. Why? It's an easy fix. (laughs) How? can cash out an account. Whose? One of mine. My first. The three suits shudder, trade looks. You're fucked up. Someone steps on his tail, he'll cry like a coyote. can't keep him off the radar forever. He's a security risk. Do your job and no one steps on his tail. Fuck him. I'm taxing him. beat. Lou acquiesces. It's your call. Alonzo smiles. And the men speak in hushed tones. Jake turns to look. Lou, Doug, Stan and Alonzo stare back at him. Jake snaps his eyes to his plate. The men murmur. Julie arrives with a fresh beer. Softly: You should know when not to listen. She quickly exits. - Alonzo and Jake exit. It's obvious something big is going down. Alonzo is excited, happy, the raid jacket underarm. He crosses to the valet -- Gimme the keys for the grey one. -- receives a key ring. Alonzo crosses to one of three plush unmarked Crown Victorias in the lot. Jake watches him open the trunk and empty his jacket inside. Alonzo returns the keys to the valet. - - Alonzo drives away. Dials his cell phone. It's me. We gotta green light. Fax the warrant to the clerk and tell her to get the judge to sign it. want you and Paul to bring it to the van. And bring some picks and shovels. Sign 'em out from maintenance. Copy that? (beat) Good. Hurry the fuck up. He hangs up. How much was in your jacket? Forty G's. What for? You wanna know? wanna know. Nothing's free in this world. Not even an arrest warrant. Jake didn't want to know. Who's it for? real bag of shit. genuine bad guy. Been investigating this vile bastard for ten years. He's a big fish in a big pond. Today fry him. The squad's gonna get some glory. Talkin' name-making shit. We'll be getting handshakes from the Chief and Mayor. Wanna piece, new guy? beat. Jake smiles. Sounds good. Hell, yeah. wanna piece. Knew you would. - In an old, hilly neighborhood near downtown. The Ride parks. Alonzo and Jake exit. Cross to a Pacific Bell repair van that Alonzo knocks on. Go away. Daddy's home. Open up. The door opens. Alonzo and Jake climb in. - - Crammed with surveillance gear. Monitors show neighborhood streets, houses. and late 2O's, dressed in jeans but obviously cops, play Streetfighter The stubbly pair has been holed up for two days. Jeff knocks Tim out. Jerk.

This afternoon we're spiking her wall for sound. Tim and Jeff beam proudly. No. You're not. Erase that shit. They trade looks. I'm not fuckin' kidding! Erase that shit. And any other horny housewife tapes you made. Right fuckin' now! Alonzo smacks the back of Tim's head. Tim hits the buttons. Ow, man. I'm erasing. Jesus. Alonzo studies a clipboard. Hurls it at Jeff.

Alonzo it Rewinds the tape of the it's connected to. Why are you being a dick? What's wrong? What's wrong? All you've done for two days is jerk off and play sega.

Instead, he hits play. - living room. familiar one -- Three beepers, three cell phones on the coffee table. Roger in his bathrobe, having a drink with Jake and Alonzo. Jake stares at the screen, stunned to see himself. Jake gives Alonzo a confused look. Okay. I'm sorry. We haven't been diligent. How can we take this gig seriously? Who's gonna fuck with him? We're gonna fuck with him. We're serving an arrest warrant. Tim and Jeff trade serious looks. We can't arrest Roger. Alonzo ejects the tape. Tosses it to Tim. Erase it. Alonzo notices an unmarked police sedan pull up to the van. Here we go. Least someone on the squad has their shit squared away. - The sedan parks by th G-Ride. Out steps a black clothes horse in Italian silk. And a steely-eyed, clean-cut chicano in a turtleneck. The van doors open. Jeff and Tim climb out. Nice suit, Mark. Beautiful suit. Now Alonzo and Jake get out. Six cops huddled in an alley. Jake fits right in with the motley bunch. Paul hands Alonzo the warrant. Thanks. My picks and shovels? In the trunk. Gonna dig a ditch? You are. Great suit. Fuck you. (shakes with Paul) Howdy, killer. Alonzo, what the fuck's going on? Don't worry. talked to the three wise men. It's all good. His men trade looks, they have total trust in him. Jake is a little nervous. If we can get away with it, let's go for it. Fuck Roger. (re: Jake) Who's this? Jake Hoyt. First day in the unit. I'm coming from Van Nuys patrol. He holds out his hand. Paul scoffs. Why's he in on this shit? Gotta pop his cherry sometime. (to Jake) Stay outta my way, boot. Alonzo notes Jake's unease, shows him the warrant. It's the real deal. Signed by the judge. Thank the Sandman. Roger's not gonna be too keen on going back to the pokey. don't care what Roger thinks. (addresses everyone) Our safety comes first. He gives us shit, we give him lead. Let's do this right so everyone can go home and do the wife and girl friend thing tonight. (checks his watch) Suit up, ladies. Time to punch in. - Five cops crouch outside the door with shotguns, machine pistols. Assault vests and helmets worn over civvies. Jake and Jeff to one side. Paul, Mark and Tim to the other. Paul and Mark give the door several quick, powerful kicks. Wood splits, hinges tear. It falls open. The five cops surge into: - - Roger reads on the couch, the morning paper. He's non- plussed to find himself surrounded by police, weapons. Freeze up! You need to not move, breath, think or blink. What are you clowns doing here? Shut up! -- New guy! His hands move, blast him. Jake aiming his shotgun at Roger's head. I'm on him. Roger, holding his newspaper, recognizes Jake. You know what you're doing, son? Jake nods: yes. Drop what's in your hands. Before zero. Five. Four. Three. Two. Two tiny derringers hit the coffee table. Roger had been palming them. Paul sweeps them aside with his foot. The cops relax a little. Roger folds his paper. Sets it down, takes off his reading glasses. principal besieged by truants. Alonzo's gonna kill you guys. Alonzo enters the shattered door. Holding picks, shovels. He drops the tools. They crash to the floor. Roger crosses his arms and glares at his friend. What's going down, Alonzo? had lunch with the three wise men. You gotta render unto Caesar. Roger sees the tools and knows exactly what they are for. Those goddamn vampires want my pension. No, man, it's not like that. You're just getting taxed. They got their boat payments and God knows what. I'm sorry. They're makin' me do it. I'm just a lowly civil servant. Fuck you. You're their bitch. What happens with me? Don't worry, bro. promised you'd never go back to prison. got your back. You won't even miss what I'm gonna take. hate doing this. Orders is orders. Sorry, dog. No, you ain't. Cop. (to Tim and Jeff) You guys are gonna work. Get the tools. (grabs Jake's shotgun) Gimme the boomer. Tim and Jeff gather the tools. Alonzo hands Jake a pick and leads the three men to a bedroom door. Roger pours a slug of Crown Royal as Paul and Mark guard him. Who's paying for my floor? The city. - - Alonzo flips the bed. Taps the floor with his toe. Open the floor. Right here. Jake, Tim and Jeff begin chopping. It's quick work to tear a large hole in the wood. Hop in, Hoyt. Couple'a of feet down, there's a locker. Jake jumps in. Attacking dirt with his pick. - (10 Jake, Tim and Jeff haul a trash-bag-wrapped footlocker out of the hole. What's in it? Open it. Jake tears away trash bags. Alonzo takes a pick and snaps the lock. Jake opens the lid -- taped bundles inside. It's coke? Go ahead. It won't bite. Jake grabs a bundle. Hefts it in his hand. Hmmm. good five kilos. Alonzo hands him a penknife. Jake pokes a hole -- nothing pours out. Cut the damn thing open. Jake does -- it is a brick of fifty dollar bills. Alonzo is relieved to see the money. Jake likes its heft. This is sweet. That's a hundred grand in your hot little hands. There's four million bucks in there. Alonzo slaps Jack's back. First day on the job and you're in on a three million dollar seizure. You said four. Told you, nothing's for free. Gotta grease the rails to make the big moves. Alonzo grabs a pillowcase. Tosses bricks of fifties in it. Hands it to Jake. Here. Lucky to get this, day-one- motherfucker. What's this? Sweet green clean legal tender. Start the kid's college fund early. Get the old lady a minivan. However pleasant the heft, Jake could never accept. He returns the pillowcase to Alonzo. No way. Only checks cash say City of on 'em. Someone didn't sleep through Ethics. You said you wanted a piece. Not like this. understand. hold on to it for you. Not everyone's comfortable the first time -- Let's wrap up. Alonzo drops the pillowcase in the locker. Exits. Jake, Tim and Jeff follow. - Roger reads a Vegas odds paper. Alonzo, Tim, Jeff and Jake enter. Roger glares at Alonzo. What have done to those guys? Are they nuts? Am supposed to stand still and let them horsefuck me? No. We can put you out of your misery. Alonzo tosses Jake the shotgun. Lemme tell you a secret, Hoyt. If you kill someone on duty, they have to be your slave in the afterlife. (points to Roger) There you go. Start an entourage. You want me to shoot him? Paul, Mark, Tim and Jeff snicker, crack smiles. Roger too. Jake plays along, points the shotgun at Roger. You'd be doin' me a favor, kid. Bang -- There. He lowers the weapon. Not gonna to do it? Of course not. This isn't funny. Alonzo smiles. Takes the shotgun from him. Man, youngsters these days. Can't get shit done unless you do it yourself. Alonzo aims at Roger... Roger is punched ragged with lifted off his couch, knocked into the wall. Jake jumps back. peal of laughter from Tim. Contagious giggles from the others. Roger gurgles. Jake stares wide-eyed at Alonzo. Holy shit! Jake's shock elicits more giggles from the squad. Finish him. Jake watches Alonzo cross to Roger, blindly gasping. He's finished. Alonzo takes one of Roger's derringers from the floor. Slaps it in the dying man's hand. C'mere, Jeff. You took fire coming through the door. Jeff smiles, gets in position so Alonzo can shoot him. Alright. Gonna get some time off. He braces himself. Alonzo aims Roger's hand. Pop! harmlessly into Jeff's vest. He removes his sunglasses from a pocket. Watch my Oakleys. Jake looking at Roger, it's hard watching him die. Again Jeff braces. Pop! The of another How's that? Jeff probing his hand under the vest. Fine. Alonzo drops the gun in an envelope marked: Jake can't believe what he just saw. Listen up. This is the scenario. Mark and Paul kick the door. Jeff is first through. Roger opens fire. Hits Jeff twice. Jeff coughs -- bright foamy blood in his hand. Oh, shit. One go through? Jeff answers by coughing more blood. Tim runs to him. Siddown, dude. Jeff does. Tim opens the vest -- a hole in a seam on the edge. Underneath, bruised puckered flesh drools blood. You shot him! You fuckin' shot me! Call a rescue. You're fine. You'll get a medal. Call the Let me run the scenario and will. Okay -- Mark and Paul kick the door. First through is Jeff. Bang. Bang. Gets hit. Wounded. Second through is our new guy, Hoyt. He drops the suspect with some fine shotgun work. (points at Mark) Who shot Roger? The new guy. Came in spraying. Paul? The boot shot him. What'd you guys see? Hoyt blasted him. Hoyt went for it -- Now will you get me a fucking rescue ambulance? Jake looks at these guys. They look back, smiling, smirking. He feels dizzy, sick as the nightmare sinks in. Jeff coughs blood. Alonzo tosses his rover to Paul. (into rover) Eleven forty-nine. Nine-nine- eight. Shots fired. Shots fired. Man down. Fifty-nine fifty-one Baxter Street. (slaps Jake's back) Good job, son. Congratulations. Gonna get a medal of valor. ... didn't shoot him... Roomful of cops says you did. Fuck you. don't care. didn't shoot him. You did. Alonzo pulls his gun. Aims at Jake's face. (as a newscaster) Los Angeles Police Department narcotics officer was killed serving a high risk warrant in Echo Park today. An spokesperson said the young officer was survived by his wife and infant child. (himself) Shit gets deeper. Get the picture? got the picture. Jake strikes -- twists back Alonzo's gun sharply -- sweeps away his legs with a kick. Alonzo finds himself on his back, Jake's knee on his neck, staring down the maw of his own pistol. That's the second time you've stuck a gun in my face. Won't be a third. Paul presses his Beretta against Jake's temple. Be my pleasure putting a hydrashock in your melon. Tim, Jeff, Mark gawk at the Mexican standoff. But I'm gonna be cool. Open your hand slowly. Drop the weapon. Jake's free hand inches to his holstered gun -- (super-calm) Hey, sorry, man. Relax, okay7 -- and snatches it -- He swings on Tim -- who swings his .45 on Jake. three-way standoff. Wanna shoot me, Paul? Go ahead. Because these two are gonna be wiping my ass in the netherworld. beat. Then: Alonzo. This is bad. This dude's a fuckin' fed. He's no fed. Just a choirboy with heart who got the drop on you fools. Everyone, let's take a deep breath and defuse this -- Jake? You hear me? You can't just spring this shit on me. never signed up for this. hear you. know you're angry -- Paul, Tim, please put down your guns. Hell no. Choirboy first. approach. Lots of them. Both of you: guns down. Now. Paul and Tim reluctantly lower their weapons. Jake lifts his knee off Alonzo's neck, stands and backs away, aiming both pistols at Alonzo, who climbs to his feet. Jake, use your ears and listen. Sometimes we take shit all the way. That's the nature of the game. We don't do this every day. No one will ever again ask you to pull a trigger you don't want to -- Mark, where're you transferring to? Westside Homicide. Westside Homicide -- Only made detective last test. Jake, give me eighteen months and I'll give you a career. We make the big arrests. We make the big seizures. When someone's in my unit they're in all the way or not at all. thought you were man enough to handle this shit. Alonzo calmly pours himself a whisky. Five proven, decorated officers say you were the shooter. Investigators are gonna pull a tube of your blood and test for intoxicants. Remember all the you smoked today? Jake does, wincing at his stupidity. You've been planning this all day. I've been planning this all week. You start talking crazy shit, will make sure the right sample goes to the lab. Still wanna talk your babynuts around the block? You won't make it to the corner. But if you're cool. You're a hero. virgin shooter above suspicion. Jake looks at Roger, gasping like a beached carp. The are getting closer. Alonzo gulps his drink and -- Pfffffst! Spits the booze in Jake's face. Jake is blinded. Paul seizes Jake's wrists and aims the pistols at the ceiling. Alonzo wrenches the pistols from his hands. Jake wipes his eyes, looks at the roomful of crazy cops, scared. Paul points at Roger's other derringer, laying on the carpet. Alonzo, there's two shots in that stinger. Let's kill your boy right now and say Roger dumped him coming through the door. Mark, Tim, Jeff like the idea. Jake doesn't. And lucky for him, neither does Alonzo. He stands protectively in front of Jake. No. We're not killing him. He's a good guy. Man's got the magic. Just having a little freakout is all. We've all been there. say he's cool. No one's gonna hurt him. Jake and Alonzo trade a look. The are close. Alonzo returns Jake his gun. Hoyt, you gotta decision to make. In thirty seconds, this place will be overrun with patrolmen. Go outside and clear your head. Or shoot me now. Jake is only too happy to get out of there. Jake crosses to exit, pauses, an afterthought? Hey, Paul. Crack! Jake nails his jaw. Paul staggers, almost falls. To Jake as he exits: You're dead! I'm takin' you out. don't care. Kick back, Wyatt Earp. Gotta respect a motherfucker who puts you on queer street with one punch. Alonzo catches his men trading looks. Kid's got more balls than all you faggots combined. - - - from a distant hilltop. The ambulances and black and whites out front shimmer in golden afternoon heat.

Here's the vitals: sixty and palpitated. Respiration thirty- one, decreased on the left with hyper-resonance. Roger is lifted into an ambulance. Alonzo dismisses Jeff's paramedics and huddles with his men. - Alonzo crosses to the G-ride with an armload of gear. Pops the trunk. Dumps everything inside. He shuts the trunk. Dials his cell phone and gets in the car. leaning against a phone pole. Watching as Alonzo pulls a clipboard from under his seat and puts on reading glasses. Alonzo begins writing a major incident report as he talks on his cell. beat. Alonzo the Motions for Jake to get in. - - Jake gets in. Alonzo with his reading glasses, the clipboard on his steering wheel, filling in the report, talking on his cell phone, laughing. -- you're gonna be scrubbing the bathtub, homie. Later. Alonzo hangs up. Preoccupied with filling in little boxes on the report as he drives slowly down the alley. Why didn't you take off? There's nowhere to run. Roger was at Good Samaritan. Let's get the paper rolling now. Alonzo looks at Jake, sees his torment. Justifiable homicide in the line of duty. Anyone'd be proud to have that in their jacket. Not this way. Say don't play along? At this point it behooves you not to fuck around. That's the truth. And Jake knows it. We can almost hear his heart breaking. Jake stares out the window a beat, clenching his jaw, finally he looks at Alonzo, stares at Alonzo's scary, empty eyes. Amazed to be utterly trapped by them. It can't be like this. beat. It is like this. Jake has a lump in his throat as they drive in silence for a long beat. Look, the money gave you, keep it. Told you, don't want it. Just take it. Throw it in the ocean. Barbecue it. Just take it. It would make the boys feel better. Fuck their feelings. Jake, they're worried. About what? About you. You didn't make anyone feel you were on the team back there. Fuck the team. You guys are insane. I'll go back to Valley and cut parking tickets. And tell Paul: he comes near me again, I'll shoot him. I'm really sorry exposed you to that today. It was ugly but it was necessary. Roger sold dope to kids. World's a better place because he's gone. Never seen no one die before? You're too damn soft. Bet you never missed a meal in your life. (glares at Alonzo) Missed a lot of meals growing up. Why? (pantomimes shooting up) Because the folks had to do their shit. Alonzo's amazed look: That's right. I'm in the cop business to lock up the criminals and poisoners. Not be one. Alonzo sizes up Jake anew, laments not knowing that earlier. What happened today was -- -- was murder and armed robbery. Wait. We had badges, it's different. Dammit, boy! Why can't you open your eyes and see? Jake can see. Too clearly. Softly: That man was your friend and you killed him like a fly. (ice) We weren't friends. (consoling) All the shit you're feeling now, it's going to go away. know you're scared. I'm not scared. You're terrified. know you are. Because went through the same shit. Everyone has. Jake, there's gotta be dirt on you if anyone's gonna trust you. After this is behind you, a whole new world will open up. walk a higher path. can give you the keys to all doors. What are you talking about? I'm not the asskicker once was, but you are. Want to run my unit? My guys are good but not one of those clowns is a leader. You are. Want my job? You got it. Wanna lock up criminals? This is the best place to do it. Do your time and make detective. Play the game, grow wise and change things from the inside. Jake looks at him. And realizes Alonzo is right. Let's get to the hospital and talk to Stan. He'll tell you what to say to the D.A.'s guys. - large hospital near downtown looms in the distance. -- to reveal the tough old barrios below it. Cholos drink on the sidewalk. Play grab-ass and listen to - - Alonzo parks near the gangsters. What's here? Alonzo points out a well-tended, quiet, quaint house near the Cholos. Informant of mine's in Chino. Promised I'd help out his family. Alonzo gets out. Opens the trunk. Loads up his arms with appliances. Sometimes bring food. Believe it or not, like to help out the community whenever can. (a box falls) Shit. Hoyt, help me with this. - Jake gets out, takes some boxes. And they cross to the house. With Jake following. Past staring Cholos. drunk PeeWee maddogs Jake. Jake maddogs back. You know where you're at, fool? shoves the PeeWee aside. The fuck outta the way, punk. It's business. He shakes with Alonzo. 'Sup, dog. Thought you were missing in action. 'Sup, man. You know I'm never lost. Jake and Alonzo cross to the house. of "Those're cops," spread through the Cholos. At the house's door, Alonzo knocks. beat. little girl cracks it. Hi. Got some stuff for your family. She closes it. beat. The door opens to reveal a huge, drunk Veterano sleeved with prison tattoos. He looks at the two cops. Massive, impassive. Smiley never smiles. Kitchen's this way. Alonzo enters. Jake hesitates. Then follows. - - The little girl does homework. Two fine Cholas watch the Spanish newscast. An old man dozes in a chair. Family photos on the wall -- proud line of warfighters, lots of military uniforms. Alonzo and Jake follow Smiley into: - - - and big and intimidating like Smiley, have been playing poker around a beer-bottle covered table. Smiley, Alonzo and Jake enter. Put it on the counter. Alonzo and Jake place the boxes on the counter. Sniper, Moreno, ignore Alonzo. And vice versa. Can use the head? Go for it. (to Jake) I'll be two seconds. We're already late. Alonzo exits to a hallway. Smiley opens a box. Pulls out a nice player. That's nice. Lemme get that. You get the Osterizer. This is mine. Smiley opens a microwave box. Jake reacts. The box is crammed with cash from Roger's locker. Dreamer! Got your bony ass in here! 19, an attractive young lady, enters. Smiley stacks the heavy packages in her arms. He tops it off with the pillowcase of Jake's money. Count that shit in the bedroom. Thanks, eh. was doing stuff. Learn to count, math whiz. Wait up. Smiley pulls a small electric money counter from a drawer. Dreamer's hands are full. So he balances it on her head. Don't drop it. She gives him a dirty look and exits. Smiley takes his seat and picks up his cards. He eyes Moreno. You looked at 'em. No didn't. Smiley tosses them to Sniper. Deal again. Play cards, cop? Not really. Beer? Moreno offers one. Sniper deals in Jake. No thanks. C'mon and play a hand. Don't be rude, dude. One hand. Don't sweat it. We ain't playin' for money. We gotta go. Alonzo's probably taking a dump -- Go ahead and have a seat. Sniper finishes dealing. Jake looks at the cards intended for him. Okay. One hand. Jake sits. Now he can see a shotgun against the wall by Moreno. The three Cholos check their hands, signal for more cards. Jake checks his cards. How long you been a cop? You look like you're in high school. Nineteen months. Like it? should'a been a fireman. My cousin's a fireman. And his kid's a Police Explorer. Gonna be our man on the inside. I'd love to be a jura. Drive around all day getting fucked up. Talkin' to the ladies. Any heads that talk shit, fuck 'em up. Listen to your bullshit. You couldn't hack takin' orders -- They order you around all the time. You gotta do everything they say, huh? Yeah, it's pretty strict. Especially when you're just starting out. Sounds like the service. You serve? No. Never been in the military. But half the guys work with were. was in the Army. Ranger Alert Battalion. Carried a machine gun. Kick back, Rambo -- Waddaya got, dog? Huh? Your hand, homes. Oh -- Jake lays down his cards. Three of a kind. Man... didn't get squat. He tosses away his hand, Moreno, too. Sniper shows his cards with a grin. Two pair. Sniper collects the cards. Shuffles. What are you doing? The cop won. got two pair. Three of a kind beats two pair, dumbass. See why we don't play for money? Smiley slides the deck to Jake. Your deal. Jake looks down the hall. Getting up: We have to go. I'm gonna get Alonzo. Kick back and party. Smiley pulls aside the curtain. An empty street. The G-Ride is gone. Ain't nobody out there for you. He feels like a toddler lost in a department store. He sits back down. Moreno laughs. Alonzo played you like a booger. Deal. Jake shuffles. Smiley lights a joint. Offers it to him. It's Wanna hit? No thanks. already smoked out today. Shit. I'll step on that P-dog. Sniper takes it, inhales. Jake dealing cards. The joint rounds the table. Lemme see your cohete. Your gun, dude. Let him see your gun. Under your shirt. Jake is outnumbered, outsized, outgunned. All he can do is take the pistol from his holster and show Moreno. That's down. What is it? three eighty? Three eighty stainless. Double action. Nine round mag. Lemme see it. Ain't gonna blast no one. Jake hands it over. Moreno examines it with skilled hands. Fuck a vat up with this. He hands it back. To Jake's relief. Gimme two cards. Jake does. Dreamer enters. There's extra. know. That's ours. Set it aside. Sure about the count? You count it if you don't believe me. Okay. Thanks -- Gimme three. Dreamer grabs a beer and exits. Jake deals three. Alonzo pulled off a miracle, huh? Times are tight. That's a lotta cash. Who'd he jack? (dealing cards) dunno. He jacked Roger. Blasted the dude. Moreno guffaws. Sniper chuckles. Damnnnn. Alonzo's scandalous. That's some cold shit. Vato'll jack anyone. Alonzo's a low-down dirty ruthless vato. That's why never shake his hand. He don't respect shit. (to Jake) Know what all the money's for? No. Alonzo's a hothead. Last week in Vegas some dude was talking shit so Alonzo beat his ass and killed him. Turns out the dude was somebody. He ran a big game and owed big money. Now Alonzo owes the money. How do you know? I'm the man in the middle. hear shit. They gave Alonzo till today to pay up. His name's already on a list. There's a crew up from Sinaloa to do the mission. They're gonna blast him. No one thought he could get cash like that. Dude made a pact with the devil or some shit 'cause only a miracle could'a saved his ass. It's no miracle. Alonzo takes care of business. Cops get crafty in a clinch. And get away with it -- Been to jail, cop? That's a stupid question. If he's been to jail, he wouldn't be cop. You can be a cop as long as you've never been convicted of a felony. There goes my chance. got like eighty strikes. Fuck cops. Cops turned out my little brother. That went over Jake's head. You hear me? What? He got arrested? No. Two fuckin' juras turned him out. They took his manhood. They booty-tagged him in the back of a black and white. That can't be true. Do look like I'm lyin', motherfucker? didn't say you were lying. just haven't ever heard anything like that. 'Cause you're a rookie. Put in a few years' work and you'll know what's up. Makes me wanna turn out a cop -- Ever had your shit pushed in? What? had my shit pushed in. Me too. My shit's been pushed in. Smiley? (grins) I'm always gettin' love from the homies. Smiley caresses Jake's thigh under the table. He almost leaps from his chair. Everyone laughs. Jumpy motherfucker. (disgusted) He's a fuckin' buster. You never been booty-busted? Jake tries to laugh. But it's getting weird. Hey, cop. Win this hand and we won't bust you out. Unless you want us to. Laughs. Sniper reveals his cards. got two pair again. (tossing his cards) Didn't get shit. (grins) Gotta straight. Uh-oh. This jura's gonna be wearin' a dress. Everyone looks at Jake -- well? He lays down his cards. Full house. Lucky fucker. You won. Deal again. Smiley taps the deck. Jake looks at it. At them. Deal, homie. Jake picks up the deck. Starts dealing. There's a new chick in the neighborhood. Oh yeah? What's her name? Vanessa... Vanessa Salguero. Everyone but Jake laughs. seen her around. Think she's a good girl or a bad girl? She's a good girl. Innocent. Easy to play. How's she like the neighborhood? Dunno. (to Jake) How you like the neighborhood? Jake realizes he's Vanessa. Laughter. Jake finishes dealing. Sets down the deck. Smiley arranges his hand. Gimme three. Fuck this buster. Let's get this shit over with. Looks of agreement are traded. Moreno grins at his shotgun. Sniper shifts his weight. Smiley whiteknuckling his beer. Hurry up, cop. Gimme three. Jake reaches for the deck. This happens fast: Jake flings the deck in Sniper's face. Smack! Cards scatter. Jumps up from the chair, flips the table into Moreno. Smiley a beer on Jake's head. Moreno grabbing the shotgun. Crack! Jake socks Smiley's jaw. He goes down, amazed to find himself on his ass. Crack! Sniper uppercuts Jake. Smiley grabs Jake's legs, yanks him to the deck -- kerchack! The bore of a 12 gauge and Moreno's leering face. Jake gives up, his broken scalp gushing blood. ... uncle... Dreamer pops her head in. Dang! You guys fucked him up. Get outta here. Take the girls next door. Or you're next. She gives him the finger, pops out. Smiley pats Jake down. Pockets the gun. You fucked up, fool. You know that. He finds Jake's handcuffs -- clicks his wrists together behind his back. He takes his badge, clips it on his belt. Look. I'm a cop. Gonna start taxing. Smiley commences kicking the hell out of Jake: You're under arrest. For being a cop. For being a buster. For dogging me in the mouth in my own pad. And for bleeding on my clean kitchen floor. You have the right to be kicked. And the right to be slapped. Smack! He slaps him. Everyone laughs. Smiley finishes, panting. There. Get him in the bathtub. Moreno grabs Jake's hair, Sniper grabs an arm, they jerk him to his feet. Gotta fuck this vato up. They run him out of the kitchen, Smiley follows. Pink carpet and porcelain kitties. They throw Jake into the tub -- shove his face in the drain. Smiley turns on the water -- Jake's blood whirlpooling away. Smiley grabs the shotgun from Moreno. Thumps the butt against Jake's head, flips it, shoves the muzzle in his ear. Snicks the shower curtain shut to catch the spatter. Fuckin' do it, eh. It's gonna be loud. Close the door. Moreno does. Sniper plugs his ears. Smiley braces for the recoil. Jake is dazed, like steer in a slaughterhouse chute. Wait. Lemme get his money first. Smiley nods. Moreno searches Jake's pockets, takes his wallet. Pockets forty bucks. Finds the Schoolgirl's pink change purse. Opens it, reacts. ... dang... He hands it to Smiley. Here, ese... You are gonna trip the fuck out. Smiley opens it. His face goes dead blank. He hands Moreno the shotgun. Whips aside the shower curtain. Starts slugging Jake. Emphasizes each word with a kidney punch. Pinchi... game... playing... cop... where'... you... get... this? Get what? Get what? Oh, God. Smiley slaps him with the change purse. This, stupid. Alonzo give it to you? No! found it! Where? MacArthur Park! What? Bullshit! Snick! The curtain closes. Smiley take the shotgun. Holds it to Jake's temple. Moreno angles for a peek.

He eases off the trigger. Pulls a cell phone. Dials. We're gonna get to the bottom of your bullshit. She's my cousin. She's a civilian. Ain't right involving her. He sits on the toilet. Still holding the shotgun to Jake's head, he waits for an answer. - The Schoolgirl works out Algebra proofs on a "Hello Kitty" bedspread in a pink T-shirt. She grabs her Hello? Wassup, Letty.

Smiley hands the change purse to Sniper. Get this to Letty. Smiley stands, turns off the water. He helps Jake to his feet. Unlocks the handcuffs as Jake sways, woozy. Thanks for getting my cousin's back. Jake half-smiles, not really sure if he's alive or not. Smiley tosses him a towel. Put that on your head. You're gonna stain the carpet. Where the fuckers at? Where'd you book them? didn't. Why the fuck not? Alonzo let them go. Smiley's scowl, we: - - Moreno and Sniper help Dreamer pick up broken glass.

And very dark, the streetlights have been shot out. Deceptively quiet, except for the little kid riding away on his bike. - Jake enters, wary. He rounds the misparked van. And sees the street is quiet. The glow of a cigarette on the roof of an apartment building catches his eye. He looks at a building across the street. Sees movement, a shadow, like someone taking cover. light turns off. The curtain in the window moves. Jake swallows hard and keeps walking toward Sara's apartment. The G-Ride parked out front. Thirteen men pour out like hornets from a hive. They are the gangsters he saw earlier. The bench presser leads the way, like a cat that has found a spider to play with. Jake stares unwaveringly into the man's eyes. Bench presser looks at the pillowcase curiously -- Smack! -- Jake threw a roundhouse at his throat, solidly connecting. Bench presser drops on one knee. He struggles for a breath. Clutches his throat. His homies stare in disbelief. He takes a deep breath. -- Jake's police handcuffs orbit his fist like brass knuckles.

He gestures for Jake to go ahead. Jake steps around the bench presser, only now getting air through his windpipe. Jake walks into their midst. Their faces follow him. They are behind him, around him. He is outnumbered by these hardened streetfighters. Jake prays he isn't bum-rushed. Now past them, he continues walking toward Sara's building. - Sara sits on the couch, clutching her son. Watching in the dark. Something is wrong, she's almost catatonic. We hear and to see Sara has a black eye. The flies open. It's Jake, his gun out. Jake and Sara look at each other a long beat. Two battered faces in a dead glow. She points at the bedroom. Jake crosses, opens the door. Enters. - - It's a bitch sandwich and Alonzo's in the middle. Jake crosses to the foot of the bed. Stands there. From inside the writhing flesh pile: 'Bout time you changed your mind and joined in. The two women stare at Jake, naked and immodest.

He ages a hundred years in a second. man who knows he will soon be dead. with eyes colder and blacker than a shark's. Alonzo can fool him no more. Know what learned today? It's not about money. He turns, about to walk away. And turns back around. The women shriek, dive out of the line of fire. Alonzo braces for bullets and instead hears: It's about respect. Jake leaves. As he crosses the -- ... Oh, God... Jake exits the apartment. smile slowly spreads across her face. - As Jake descends the stairs, the porch lights of a house come on. Then the lights of another house. Steel doors open. People tentatively step outside. Women and children, mothers with babies on their hips. Blue-collar fathers in shop uniforms. More porch lights come on. More doors open. The cul-de-sac has come to life. The homes are lit, their occupants filling the street, ready to bear witness. All eyes on Jake as he walks down the street. Three young boys follow him. The old woman comes out of her house to watch Jake pass. As do two pretty girls. Jake nearing the gangsters. They block the street. The bench presser stands there, arms crossed, Jake will have to go through him again. Curious eyes wonder what will happen. The bench presser gives Jake a slight nod of respect. The gangsters part for Jake and he leaves the cul-de-sac. As he walks, his innocence is gone, a heavy burden on his shoulders, but there is much strength in his gait. Jake walks past the aloof little kid, riding his bicycle in tight circles.
