Every superhero has a secret identity. don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? Of course have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what mean? Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. said, ''Girl, don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or anything like that. mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. feel like the maid. just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?'' could get to that point. ''Please?'' Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished. Sometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm right up there with the big dogs!

No, you don't have to worry about training me. know all your moves, your crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything! I'm your number one fan! Hey! Hey, wait! 3__________________________________________ You know...you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse, but maybe that's not what you had in mind. Hey, look-- Elastigirl. Mr. lncredible. No, it's all right. I've got him. Sure, you've got him. just took him out for you. Sure, you took him out. His attention was on me. fact exploited to do my job. My job, you mean. simple thank you will suffice. Thanks, but don't need any help. Whatever happened to ''ladies first''? Well, whatever happened to equal treatment? Hey, look, the lady got me first. Well, we could share, you know. work alone. Well, think you need to be more...flexible. Are you doing anything later? have a previous engagement. [whistles] Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage in an hour. Hey, lncredible! Hey, Frozone! Shouldn't you be getting ready? still got time. [crowd screaming] He's gonna jump! think you broke something. With counseling, think you'll come to forgive me. Wait a minute. [coughing] Bomb Voyage. [French] Mr. Incredible! And lncrediBoy! lncrediBoy? Hey, hey! Aren't you curious about how get around so fast? See? have these rocket boots-- Go home, Buddy. What? Now. [French] Little oaf. Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you never say which part of yourself to be true to. Well, I've finally figured out who am. am your ward... lncrediBoy! And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy. This is because don't have powers, isn't it? Well not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. invented these. can fly. Can you fly? Fly home, Buddy. work alone. [French] And your outfit is totally ridiculous! Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the police. Buddy, don't! It'll only take a second, really. No, stop! There's a bomb! Let go! You're wrecking my flight pattern! can do this if you let go! Will you just...? I'm trying to help! Stop! Let go of my cape! 4__________________________________________ Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what he's been doing. can help you. You're making a mista---hey! The injured jumper. You sent paramedics? They've already picked him up. The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who caught in the act robbing the vault. Now, we might be able to nab him if we set up a perimeter. You mean he got away? Well, yeah. Skippy here made sure of that. lncrediBoy! You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late. Listen, I've gotta be somewhere. What about Bomb Voyage? Any other night, I'd go after him myself, but really gotta go. But don't worry. We'll get him! Eventually! 5__________________________________________ Is the night still young? You're very late. How do look? Good? Oh, the mask! You still got the mask. [cracks neck] Showtime. Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? You're late. When you asked me if was doing anything later, didn't realize you'd actually forgotten. thought it was playful banter. It was playful banter. Cutting it kinda close, don't you think? You need to be more... flexible. love you, but if we're gonna make this work, you've gotta be more than Mr. lncredible. You know that. Don't you? ...so long as you both shall live? do. pronounce this couple husband and wife. [people cheering and whistling] As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens. Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen? In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court. Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't want to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so quote, causes him daily pain. Hey, saved your life! You didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what you did! Listen-- My client has no further comment at this time. Five days later, another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over. It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away. Under tremendous public pressure, and the crushing financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. 6__________________________________________ style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>(15 Denied?

Go save the world one policy at a time, honey. Oh! gotta go pick up the kids from school. See you tonight. Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we? [sobbing] I'm on a fixed income, and if you can't help me, don't know what I'll do. [blows nose loudly] [sobbing] All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but can't. I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...[whispering] Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But can't. also do not advise you to fill out and file a form with our legal department on the second floor. wouldn't expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter.

Announcement] Morning break is over. Morning break is over. 7__________________________________________ appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr. What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong? He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class. He says. Look, know it's you! He puts thumbtacks on my stool. You saw him do this? Well...not really. No. Actually, not. Oh, then how do you know it was him? hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I'm sitting down! don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? think not! Bernie... Don't ''Bernie'' me. [screaming] This little rat is guilty! You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble. You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, say, guilty! Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. more...constructive outlet. Maybe could, if you'd let me go out for sports. Honey, you know why we can't do that. promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit. Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. You always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean it. Why can't do the best that can do? Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special. Everyone's special, Dash. Which is another way of saying no one is. Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed? Hi, Tony. Hey. Hey, Tony, can carry your books? That's kind of funny. 1 Hey, Tony, do you play football? 2 Tony, thought we were gonna go swimming. He looked at me. [car horn honking] Come on, Violet! [muttering] Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway... Oh, great. [unintelligible muttering] 8__________________________________________ Mom. You're making weird faces again. No, I'm not. You make weird faces, honey. Do you have to read at the table? Uh-huh. Yeah. Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat? Ow. Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school? [nervously] Well, we dissected a frog. Dash got sent to the office again. [distracted] Good. Good. No, Bob, that's bad. What? Dash got sent to the office again. What?! What for? Nothing. He put a tack on the teacher's chair...during class. Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape. They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast did you think were you going? Bob! We are not encouraging this. I'm not encouraging, I'm just asking how fast... Honey! Great. First the car, now gotta pay to fix the table... The car? What happened to the car? Here. I'm getting a new plate. So, how about you, Vi? How was school? Nothing to report. You've hardly touched your food. I'm not hungry for meatloaf. Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are you hungry for? Tony Rydinger. Shut up! Well, you are. said, shut up, you little insect! Well, she is. Do not shout at the table. Honey! Kids! Listen to your mother. She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf. That's it! Stop it! You're gonna be toast! Stop running in the house. Sit down! Ow! Hey, no force fields! You started it. You sit down! You sit down! Violet! ''Simon Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing''? Gazerbeam. Bob! It's time to engage. Do something!

Hey, where are you two going? It's Wednesday. Oh. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius. Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids. Don't think you've avoided talking about your trip to the principal's office, young man. Your father and are still gonna discuss it. I'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office, you know. Other kids don't have superpowers. Now, it's perfectly normal... Normal? What do you know about normal? What does anyone in this family know about normal? Now, wait a minute, young lady. We act normal, mom. wanna be normal! The only normal one is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained. [Jack-Jack laughing] Lucky. meant about being normal. 9__________________________________________ So now I'm in deep trouble. mean, one more jolt of this death ray and I'm an epitaph. Somehow managed to find cover and what does Baron Von Ruthless do? He starts monologuing. He starts monologuing! He starts like this prepared speech about how feeble am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada. Yammering. Yammering! mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up. Municiberg, we have a 23-56... 23-56, what is that? Robbery? This is just sad. Yeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber? No. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up. He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just talking. What are we doing here, Bob? Protecting people. Nobody asked us. You need an invitation? I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...you remember Gazerbeam? Yeah. There was something about him in the paper. He had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too. When's the last time you saw him? don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And we're pushing our luck as it is. Oh, come on. It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're gonna get-- We have a report on a fire... fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby! We're gonna get caught. Woohoo! Haha! Fire! Yeah! Is that everybody? Yeah, that's everyone. It better be. Can't you put this out? can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too fast! Well, what's that mean? It means it's hot! And I'm dehydrated, Bob! You're out of ice? You can't run out of ice! thought you can use water in the air! There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out of muscle? just can't go smashing into walls! The building's getting weaker by the second! It's gonna come down on top of us! wanted to go bowling! All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot! Yeah. [realizes they're in a jewelry store...] Uh-oh. [...and unknowingly trips the alarm] Oh, good. [alarm sounds] Oh, now...that ain't right! - We look like bad guys! Incompetent bad guys! - You can get water out of the air! Freeze! Freeze! I'm thirsty. said freeze! I'm just getting a drink. Alright. You've had your drink. Now want you to... know. know. Freeze. [police radio chatter] Shots fired! Police officers! That was way too close. We are not doing that again. [over radio] Verify you want to switch targets? Over. Trust me. This is the one he's been looking for. 10__________________________________________ thought you'd be back by 11 . said I'd be back later. assumed you'd be back later. lf you came back at all...you'd be ''back later''. Well, I'm back, okay? Is this rubble? [with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose. You know how feel about that, Bob. Darn you! We can't blow cover again! The building was coming down anyway. What?! You knocked down a building?! It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down anyway. Tell me you haven't been listening to the police scanner again? Look, performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing. It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a very bad thing. Reliving the glory days is better than acting like they didn't happen! Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation. It's not a graduation. He's moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade. It's a ceremony! It's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional... This is not about you, Bob. This is about Dash. You want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually compete. Let him go out for sports! will not be made the enemy here! You know why we can't do that. Because he'd be great! This is not about you! All right, Dash. know you're listening. Come on out. Vi? You, too, young lady. Come on. Come on out. It's okay, kids. We're just having a discussion. Pretty loud discussion. Yeah. But that's okay. Because what's important is that Mommy and are always a team. We're always united against, uh, the forces of, uh... Pigheadedness? was gonna say evil or something. We're sorry we woke you. Everything's okay. Go back to bed. It's late. Good night, Mom. Night, Dad. Good night. In fact, we should all be in bed. [crickets chirping, dog barks] 11__________________________________________ [on phone] Request claim on claim numbers 158183... [over the intercom] Haven't you got him yet?! Where is he?! [over the intercom] Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office. Now? [over the intercom] Now. Sit down, Bob. I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. Ask me why. Okay. Why? Why what? Be specific, Bob. Why are you unhappy? Your customers make me unhappy. What, you've gotten complaints? Complaints can handle. What can't handle is your customers' inexplicable knowledge of lnsuricare's inner workings! They're experts. Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle! They're penetrating the bureaucracy! Did do something illegal? No. Are you saying we shouldn't help our customers? The law requires that answer no. We're supposed to help people. We're supposed to help our people! Starting with our stockholders, Bob. Who's helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company... Is like an enormous clock. ...is like an enormous clo--yes. Precisely. It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. [chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob. You know what mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr! That man out there, he needs help. Do not change the subject, Bob. We're discussing your attitude! He is getting mugged! Well, let's hope we don't cover him. I'll be right back. Stop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over here, now. I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. He got away. Good thing, too. You were this close to losing your jo-- Uh-oh. 12__________________________________________ How is he? He'll live. I'm fired, aren't Oh, you think? What can say, Rick? Nothing you haven't said before. Someone was in trouble. Someone's always in trouble. had to do something. Yeah. Every time you say those words, it means a month and a half of trouble for me, Bob. It means hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's dollars. know. We gotta pay to keep the company quiet. We gotta pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder. Money, money, money, money. We can't keep doing this, Bob! We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, you're on your own. Listen, Bob. Maybe could relocate you, you know, for old times' sake. No, can't do that to my family. Everyone just got settled. I'll make it work. Thanks. Take care of yourself. Well, what are you waiting for? don't know. Something amazing, guess. [sighs] Me too, kid. 13__________________________________________ Huh? ''Hold still''? Match: Mr. Incredible. Room is secure.

Yes, it is. [phone ringing] [over phone] Hello? This is Mr. lncredible. I'm in. 15__________________________________________ The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted with. And, unfortunately... Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders. We lost control. And now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety. How am going in? The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet. lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track. Although we're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment. You want me to shut it down without completely destroying it. You are Mr. lncredible. I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot. Every moment you spend fighting it only increases its knowledge of how to beat you. Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don't destroy it. And don't die. Great. Thanks.

Surely, you of all people understand that. was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why live... With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am It's a weakness we share. Seems a bit unstable. prefer to think of it as misunderstood. [chuckling] Aren't we all? Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare? Everything's delicious. 17__________________________________________ Jeez. Hurry, honey. Or you'll be late for work. Have a great day, honey. Thanks. Help customers, climb ladders... Bring bacon? All that jazz. You have an appointment? I'm an old friend. just wanted to...

But accept. It will be bold. Dramatic! Yeah. Heroic! Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots... No capes! Isn't that my decision? Do you remember Thunderhead? Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids. Listen, November 15th of '58. All was well, another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin. Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb... Stratogale! April 23rd, '57. Cape caught in a jet turbine. you can't generalize about these things. Meta-man, express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on takeoff. Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes! Now, go on. Your new suit will be finished before your next assignment. You know I'm retired from hero work. As am l, Robert.

You know, went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasn't good enough! After you trashed the last one, had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. mean, after all...I am your biggest fan. Buddy? My name is not Buddy! And it's not lncrediBoy either! That ship has sailed.
