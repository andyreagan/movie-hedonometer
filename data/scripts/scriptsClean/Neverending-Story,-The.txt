Bastian: Morning Dad if !supportEmptyParas!endif! Bastian continues to struggle with the jar until his hand hurts. His father turns to him and gives him a hand. He seems to easily open the jar.

( Pause ) if !supportEmptyParas!endif! As for those riding lessons you've been wanting you say you love horses yet you seem to be afraid to get on a real one. Now, Bastian, you're old enough to get your head out of the clouds and start keeping both feet on the ground. Alright ? if !supportEmptyParas!endif! (he takes a sip of drink.) if !supportEmptyParas!endif! Bastian: Ok. if !supportEmptyParas!endif! Father: Stop daydreaming and start facing your problems. Ok ?

Bully 1: style="mso-spacerun: yes"> Hey man, who said you could get out of the garbage ? Get back in there. if !supportEmptyParas!endif!

Rockbiter: My people are sending me to the Ivory Tower, to the Empress for help if !supportEmptyParas!endif! Nighthob and Tiny: We are.. if !supportEmptyParas!endif! Tiny: We are on the same mission. After all, if the Empress can't save us, who could? if !supportEmptyParas!endif! Nighthob: Then why are we all just standing around here instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower? if !supportEmptyParas!endif! Tiny: Right, what are we waiting for ? if !supportEmptyParas!endif! if !supportEmptyParas!endif! The little man climbs on his snail while the Nighthob tries to wake up his bat. Nighthob: Hey wake up!
