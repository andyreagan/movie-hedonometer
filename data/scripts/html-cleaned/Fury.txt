          OVER A BLACK SCREEN:
                         
          April 1945 -- The Allied Armies strike at the heart of
          Germany. In four weeks the Third Reich will be no more...
                         
          EXT. FARMER'S FIELD - PREDAWN
                         
          Thick morning fog blankets all. A faint glow in the East.
          It's quiet save for the DISTANT RUMBLE of artillery.
                         
          Super title: Somewhere in Nazi Germany...
                         
          A Spanish Arabian STALLION emerges from the fog. A wasp
          waisted German Army LIEUTENANT erect in its saddle. His
          disciplined horse elegantly picks its way over the furrowed
          soil. A dark hulk looms in the mist -- Horse and rider
          approach...
                         
          IT'S A BURNED OUT TANK -- An American Sherman. Still
          smoldering. Steel armor ripped open like tin foil.
                         
          The Lieutenant moves on. Encounters another charred tank.
          Its entire turret blown off. A small fire still burns inside.
          Around it are the blackened twisted shapes of burnt shrunken
          men.
                         
          He moves on. Another hulk emerges from the most -- This tank
          looks like a scrap heap -- Sandbags, railroad ties, sloppy
          steel plate, cases of wine, rations and ammunition.
          Battered, scarred and seemingly abandoned.
                         
          The Lieutenant guides his horse in a slow circle around the
          armored vehicle. He HEARS a faint CLINK -- And draws his
          Luger from its shiny black holster -- THEN:
                         
          An AMERICAN SOLDIER hiding BEHIND THE TURRET leaps on him...
                         
          Tearing the German from his horse. The two men CRASH to the
          ground. The American stabs the Lieutenant in the face --
          THWICK-THWICK-THWICK! Fast, violent, shocking...
                         
          The American then carefully slides the knife blade behind the
          German's eye - Piercing his brainpan with a CRACK. The German
          convulses for a moment. And dies...
                         
          The American retrieves his knife. Wipes it clean on the
          German's uniform and scans the area with burning primal eyes.
                         
          This is DON "WARDADDY" COLLIER. Late twenties he looks middle
          aged. A light beard and hollow cheeks. Years of combat have
          ground him into something hard and sharp.

                         CONTINUED:
                         
          With the mechanical clumsiness of exhaustion, Wardaddy cuts
          the mapcase from the German's belt. Then rips the large
          Knight's Cross medal from the dead man's neck.
                         
          Wardaddy stands to his full impressive height in his oil
          blackened overalls. He crosses to the horse. He grabs the
          beautiful animal's bridal and looks at it for a moment...
                         
          Eye to eye. Connection with the animal. With incredible
          gentleness he rubs its muzzle. And kisses it...
                         
          Then he pulls his knife -- The horse jerks back, but Wardaddy
          holds it firm. He knows horses...
                         
          THWICK! - He cuts off the bridle, slips the bit from its
          mouth. He unbuckles the saddle and drops it to the soil.
          Wardaddy looking at the horse. Then it heads back the way it
          came - Now without ride and tack...
                         
          Wardaddy climbs aboard his tank -- Her name is "FURY" -- It's
          painted on her cannon.
                         
          INT. FURY - PREDAWN
                         
          Dark. Cramped. Crowded. A filthy machine with filthy men.
          There's two main areas - THE TURRET BASKET -- A big
          cylindrical cage that spins with the turret.
                         
          And the BOW -- The front of the tank where the driver and a
          machine gunner sit. The sound of piss hitting tin...
                         
          BOYD "BIBLE" SWAN is draped casually across the cannon
          breech. A pastor's kid from Des Moines, he's serious, calm,
          centered. You'd never guess he's killed a thousand men. He
          finishes urinating into an ammo can.
                         
          TRINI "GORDO" GARCIA sits in the driver's seat sipping wine
          from a bottle. A Mexican butcher from Chicago. He's been
          drunk since 1942. He once went into combat sober - And vowed
          never to do it again.
                         
          Next to Gordo, the transmission housing between them, is the
          body of RED. A blood soaked jacket pulled over his head. His
          blood spattered inside the tank.
                         
          GRADY "COON-ASS" TRAVIS, a good-old-boy from Arkansas, is
          wedged into the battery compartment fixing a short. He's
          cunning, viscous and World wise.
                         
          Wardaddy drops down into the Commander's hatch.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Get that fucker?

                          WARDADDY
           I knocked him off.
                         
          Gordo offers Red a drink, pushes the bottle into his
          shoulder. Whispers to him...
                         
                          BIBLE
           Gordo. Stop. Leave him rest.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           He's dead. Or did you forget? Drunk damn
           fool.
                         
          Gordo shoots them a dirty look. Keeps whispering to his dead
          friend. Wardaddy watches Coon-Ass work.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Goddammit. Ain't you done?
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Keep ridin' me.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I'm not riding you. If I was, you'd know
           it. More where he came from.
                         
          Wardaddy tosses Bible the Knight's Cross - Bible hangs it in
          the turret - Where more German combat decorations hang like
          Christmas ornaments.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           You get some canned bacon for this?
                         
          He tosses Gordo the dead Officer's Luger. He inspects it.
                         
                          GORDO
           For this? Yeah. A case or two.
                         
          Wardaddy lights a cigarette. Then scratches another notch in
          his knife with his GI can opener. It's tense - They are
          behind German lines and acutely aware of the danger they're
          in. But danger becomes routine. After years of it...
                         
          Coon-Ass smirks - KNOWING he'll get a rise...
                         
                          COON-ASS
           How come you didn't shoot that horse? You
           love shooting horses so much.
                         
          Wardaddy darkens with outrage -- He works his way over to
          Coon-Ass and begins kicking the Hell out of him.
                         
                          COON-ASS (CONT'D)
           Stop it! What's that for?

           You know what it's for.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Why you always whoopin' on me?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Because you're an animal. A dog. All you
           understand is the fist and boot.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Bull-sheeet. I understand me the pussy
           and the gun. Killin' and fuckin'.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           In that order?
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Maybe. Timing's important. I like me warm
           pussy. Pipin' hot.
                         
                          GORDO
           You still talking? Can we get out of
           here? Everyone shut up.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           You shut up. You're a goddamn bottle of
           wine. Stink like wine. Think like wine.
           Alcohol never solved nothing.
                         
                          GORDO
           Neither did milk. Let's go. Vamanos.
           Vamanos ya.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Wanna talk Mexican? Find another tank. A
           Mexican tank. This is an American tank.
           We talk American.
                         
                          GORDO
           Who put a nickel in you? You talk Kraut.
           You can talk German and I can't talk
           Spanish?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I use my German as a tool of war.
                         
          Coon-Ass grabs his crotch...
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Here's my tool of war.
                         
          Bible realizes this isn't about horses or Spanish. It's about
          Red -- The man with his head blown off in the Bow Gunner's

          Coleman stove.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Thanks, Boyd.
                         
                          BIBLE
           Stop ragging on everyone. You didn't kill
           Red. The German's did.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           That's true. But I sure didn't keep him
           alive.

           His number came up. That's all. We've
           been lucky. Until now. Settle down.
                         
          Wardaddy adds sugar to his coffee. Stirs it with a greasy
          callused finger. He opens the German's mapcase -- Discovers
          several maps...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Thank heavens. We got a map.
                         
          Wardaddy studies a German map...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           We're here. Battalion Area's to the
           South. This hardball road here'll get us
           back. Sound good?
                         
                          COON-ASS
           You got the stripes, Daddy. You figure it
           out.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I got more, boy. Need more?
                         
          Wardaddy pokes his head out of the commander's hatch and
          listens carefully to the coming dawn. His finely tuned
          instincts kick in. Wardaddy drops back inside - Pulls the
          hatch shut with a CLANK...
                         
                         THEN:
                         
          The sound of ROARING LOCOMOTIVES -- An Artillery barrage is
          on the way...
                         
          BOOM-BOOM-KABOOM! -- Shells explode around the tank. Rocking
          it. For the moment the men are safe in their steel cocoon.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Coon-Ass? Anytime, sweetheart.

          Gordo pushes the starter button. Expectant faces. The engine
          RUMBLES but doesn't catch.
                         
          MORE EXPLODING SHELLS -- Incredibly loud. Shrapnel PINGS off
          the hull. They endure it with their trademark stoicism.
          They've been through it before - But a direct hit can kill
          them...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Choke'er up. She's cold.
                         
          Gordo opens the choke. Tries again. The engine rumbling.
          Doesn't start. Worried faces.
                         
                          GORDO
           There's condensation on the plugs.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Plugs're good. Don't flood it.
                         
                          GORDO
           Drunk or not I can start a damn tank.
                         
          VROOM! -- The engine ROARS to life. They are relieved. Low
          key and businesslike, they don their headsets - It's now
          unbelievably loud in the tank. Coon-Ass joins Wardaddy and
          Bible in the turret basket.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Move out!
                         
          Gordo double-clutches and shifts into first. The tank
          lurches. Bible presses his eye to the gunsight...
                         
          Wardaddy rotates the turret with his THUMBSWITCH, looking
          outside through a PERISCOPE.
                         
          BEHIND GORDO -- We see the turret basket rotating, the legs
          of Wardaddy, Bible, and Coon-Ass standing inside - It's an
          impressive sight...

           Forward! Pick it up! Forward!
                         
          The tank RATTLES. CLANKS and SHUDDERS. Ammo cases, weapons, C-
          rations vibrate. We are in the belly of the beast.
                         
          KABOOM-BOOM-BOOM! -- Shells explode dangerously close. The
          tank shudders. Gordo clutches, shifts into second. Stomps
          the gas. The tank builds speed. Wardaddy SEES the road...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Drive! Left. Left. Left.
                         
          ON GORDO - Turning the tank with the two big steering levers.
          He whips it onto the road, upshifts into third gear. The tank
          builds speed - Moving surprisingly fast.
                         
          Gordo can sure drive a tank. Eyes riveted to his periscope.
          Gas, oil, blood and piss sloshing over his boots. Red's body
          in the seat next to him.
                         
          Leaving the CRASHING artillery behind...
                         
          Out of immediate danger, Wardaddy opens his hatch and takes
          his normal position - Exposed from the chest up in the
          commander's hatch. He grips a captured German assault rifle,
          grimly scanning for threats with his cold hard eyes.
                         
          The Fury has escaped. Her crew is neither grateful or
          relieved. There is work to do. The war is not over...
                         
          EXT. BATTALION AREA - DAY
                         
          A farmer's field has been overrun by a traveling circus of
          death - An American Armored Battalion. A couple thousand men.
          A couple hundred vehicles. The TIRED MEN load TIRED VEHICLES
          for another day on the attack. Months of spearheading into
          Germany have taken their toll.
                         
          A BOOMING ARTILLERY BATTERY pumps rounds into German targets
          miles away. The BLACK DRIVERS of the Redball Express Trucks
          unload heaps of supplies from their trucks.
                         
          MECHANICS, CLERKS, COOKS, and MPs move with purpose.
          INFANTRYMEN clean weapons. A CHAPLAIN gives last rights
          outside the surgery tent as MEDICS line up more litters of
          WOUNDED MEN.
                         
          A hundred GERMAN PRISONERS sit listlessly behind barbed wire.
          A BULLDOZER plows a heap of dad Germans into a pit.
                         
          A ROW OF FIFTEEN SHERMAN TANKS -- Their busy CREWS ready them
          for another day's push into Germany. The tankers stop working
          and stare in amazement.

          HERE COMES THE FURY -- Driving up fast, it deftly spins and
          parks perfectly alongside the newer, cleaner tanks. SERGEANT
          DAVIS, commander of the Lucy Sue shakes his head.
                         
           SGT. DAVIS
           Thought you were dead, Collier.

           The Devil watches over his own.
                         
          Wardaddy jumps down. A pair of MEDICS approach the tank with
          a litter. Wardaddy and Gordo haul Red's corpse out of the
          tank and lay him onto the litter.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Take care of him. He was a good man.
                         
          The Medic SEES the top of Red's head is gone.
                         
                          MEDIC
           You said you had wounded. We're not
           graves registration.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Take good care of him. Or I'll take good
           care of you.
                         
          Wardaddy pats his assault rifle with menace. The Medics trade
          looks and depart with the body. Gordo crawls under the tank
          and passes out in the mud.
                         
          LIEUTENANT PARKER approaches Wardaddy. Young and fresh, he
          has just a month with the outfit. He's intimidated Wardaddy,
          this tough tanker hard tempered by war's hammer.
                         
           LT. PARKER
           Sergeant I was afraid you were dead. I'm
           awful sorry about T-5 Conley.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           It's Red. We call him Red.

           Tell him we drove straight into a
           strongpoint. Two Kraut tanks were dug in
           like pillboxes. I got ;em both. After
           they got everyone else.
                         
           LT. PARKER
           We're moving again. Headquarters
           section's already folding. You're in my
           platoon now. We're assigned to check out
           a town while main unit bypasses.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           A goddamned flank guard mission?
                         
          Wardaddy nods at the Fury. Looking even more ragged in the
          daylight.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Lieutenant, I gotta short in the master
           switch box. Steering linkage is rattling.
           Engine's losing compression. Oil's in the
           radiator. Bogies need rubber. There's a
           75 gouge on the turret that'll take
           twenty pounds of welding rod to fill in.
           She's a mess. So's my crew.
                         
           Lt. PARKER
           Make ready to depart the company area on
           my order.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Yessir. Fuck my life.
                         
          The young officer spins on his heels and walks off. Wardaddy
          looks at Bible and Coon-Ass, staring at him from atop the
          tank. Just crushed. Beaten, exhausted. Spent.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Parker's a douchebag. We working for that

                          WARDADDY
           Don't you worry about him. You work for
           me. Restock ammo and rations. Wake up
           Gordo. Have him top off the water and
           gas. Do what you can about the mechanical
           issues.

          intercepts Wardaddy.

           dollar bill. Puppy breath and all.
                         
          Wardaddy lights a smoke. An outgoing volley from the nearby
          Artillery Company makes Norman flinch.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Don't worry about outgoing. Incoming
           mail's the issue. Nazis can drop an 88
           shell in your hip pocket from two miles
           out.
                         
          Wardaddy directs him to the Fury...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           That's home. Do what you're told. And
           don't get too close to no one.
                         
          Wardaddy walks off. Norman approaches the tank. Bible and
          Coon-Ass scrutinize the newcomer. Gordo slides out from under
          the hull, bathed in mud. The three feral tankers eye Norman.
          Gordo grabs Norman's dufflebag and searches it. Norman afraid
          to stop him.
                         
                          NORMAN

          as he scrubs off blood with a rag. He pauses to stare at the
          big belt fed machine gun - Also spattered with blood. He
          cleans it gently. As if afraid of waking a dangerous animal.
                         
          Norman removes blood spattered pin-up girls. And a photo of
          Red's wife - The tough cattle ranching woman who has no idea
          her man is dead. He reaches for a photo of Red in cowboy
          regalia astride a horse -- And freezes...

          Love Company's tanks are being readies for combat. Gas tanks
          are filled. Equipment is oiled and cleaned. Ammo loaded. Busy
          green monkeys scrambling over big green turtles.
                         
          ON THE FURY: Coon-Ass and Bible load ammo into the turret.
          Wardaddy and Gordo tighten track links with wrenches.
                         
          Norman scrambles out of the tank and tumbles over the side.
          Landing on his hands and knees, he vomits his ham and eggs
          into the mud...
                         
          Coughing and sputtering he looks up in time to see a 6x6

          Norman stands, brushes off the mud. About to climb back in
          the tank, he pauses and stares with his mouth agape.
                         
          Two TIRED GI'S escort an SS SERGEANT. His hands tied behind
          his back with bailing wire. His head is SWOLLEN like a
          watermelon. Puffy slits for eyes, blood slicked hair. He's
          taken a serious beating.

           What's your favorite color? You like
           chicken or beef? You a good dancer? You

          The stoic prisoner blinks with confusion...
                         
          THWICK! -- Wardaddy buries his knife in the SS Sergeant's
          chest. Smack in the heart. And works it side to side.
                         
          The GI's shake their heads with weary dismay. Bible and Coon-
          Ass pull Wardaddy away. Gordo cackles with delight.
                         
                          TIRED GI

          The Tired GI's drop their prisoner. They look at Wardaddy

          Wardaddy ignores him. Norman watches the men go, shocked.
          Wardaddy spits. Wipes his knife clean.
                         
                          NORMAN

          Wardaddy shoves an ugly stamped metal submachine-gun into

          Wardaddy makes the "crank it up" hand sign. Gordo slides in
          the driver's hatch and starts the Fury.
                         
          The other four tank start up - Their ENGINES ROAR. The 25 men
          of 1st Platoon take their fighting positions inside the steel
          beasts. Wardaddy mounts the Fury. Norman too. One man
          confident and seasoned. The other clumsy and hesitant.

          Gunner's hatch. It's like stuffing a cat in a bathtub.

          He's holding a live GRENADE.
                         
          BOOM! -- It blows the Corporal's hand clean off, shreds his
          forearm. Sgt. Davis is livid.
                         
           SGT. DAVIS
           Bless your heart. You done went and did

           yellow fuck.
                         
          The Corporal climbs out of the hatch, slides down the front
          of the tank and trudges toward an ambulance clutching his
          shattered arm. Norman saw everything. He looks at Wardaddy,
          amazed and confused. Who just shrugs and locks and loads his
          big. .50 Cal machine gun.

           out.
                         
          The Fury falls in behind Lt. Parker's tank. Then Sgt. Davis'
          tank. Then Peterson and Binkowski's tanks.
                         
          The 5 tanks of 1st PLATOON move out in a column. Each tank
          running over the dead SS Sergeant - Flattening him into the
          mud. No sentimentality here. It's just business.

          pass the OUTPOST TANK - Marking the scrimmage line between
          the American Army and the Nazis.

          Wardaddy waves goodbye. The tank column passes a field where
          dozens of foxholes are filled with INFANTRYMEN. At the sound
          of a WHISTLE a hundred ragged green men emerge from the earth
          like spawning locusts and shuffle toward waiting trucks.

           you. Got that?
                         
                          NORMAN
           Okay. Thank you.
                         
          Norman looks up at Wardaddy in the Commander's hatch. He
          looks like he was born like that - An iron centaur, half man
          half tank. Wardaddy speaks to him through the intercom...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Kid, you hear me, you plugged in?
                         
          Norman fumbles with the intercom switch, replies:
                         
                          NORMAN
           I hear you, Sergeant.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Don't fire that bow gun until I tell you.
           Got that? Don't want you plastering our
           guys.

           Okay, Sarge.
                         
          Gordo kills off his bottle of wine, throws it at the back of
          the Lieutenant's tank, shattering it.
                         
                          GORDO
           Kid, you play cards? Blackjack? Poker?
                         
                          NORMAN
           No. I don't play cards.

          FARMER riding a hay wagon pulled by two old horses. Columns

          600 yards away it's well camouflaged in a group of trees.
                         
          It blows the wing off the low-flying fighter plane.
                         
          The aircraft corkscrews into a field and EXPLODES VIOLENTLY
          as its bomb load detonates. Sudden. Shocking.

          Bible presses his face against the gun's telescopic sight. He

          about 10 or 11 - Big signs around their necks...

          The men in the Fury stare at the dead children. Wardaddy is
          face to face with them. He's up so high.

           What do the signs say?
                         
          Wardaddy paraphrases the German scrawls on the signs.
                         
                          WARDADDY

           "I helped traitors to Germany."
                         
          Norman gasps, looking at the bodies. Stunned by the senseless
          cruelty.
                         
                          GORDO
           They did that shit in France and Belgium.
           Now they're doing it to their own people.

          Norman watches the world go by through his periscope block.
          Seeing Germany through the small glass prism...
                         
          Norman's PERISCOPE POV - MOVEMENT in the ditch alongside Lt.
          Parker's tank - An 11 Y.O. HITLER YOUTH aims a Penzerfaust
          anti-tank rocket at the Lieutenant's tank - He's a scared
          child, fear on his face, trembling.
                         
          Norman can't believe that he's seeing - He hesitates.
                         
          EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY
                         
          FWOOSH! - The Hitler Youth fires the rocket. It slams square
          into the side of Lt. Parker's tank...
                         
          KABOOM! - A perfect hit on the ammunition storage. The result
          is instant and catastrophic as a jet of molten steel ignites
          the cannon ammunition...
                         
          A column of intense flame erupts from the commander's hatch
          like a giant blow torch. Lt. Parker is immolated like a
          human candle.

          The burning tank rolls to a stop. The Driver's hatch opens.
          The DRIVER crawls out - Flops on the ground. Burning alive,
          he pulls his pistol from his shoulder holster...
                         
          BAM! - And shoots himself in the head.
                         
          Wardaddy and the other three tank commanders scanning for
          more Germans. All clear. Into radio...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Keep an eye out.
                         
          Wardaddy climbs out of his hatch. Coon-Ass covers him with a
          big. 50 Cal machine gun.
                         
          Wardaddy approaches the burning tank. AMMUNITION begins to
          EXPLODE. It is a total loss. No survivors.
                         
          Wait - The BOW BUNNER'S hatch opens. Belching fire and smoke.
          The A-DRIVE flails in the open hatch. Roasting alive.
          Trapped. Hopeless.
                         
          BRDDDDT! - Wardaddy finishes him off. Then, he crosses to the
          Hitler Youth in the ditch - He's still alive. Wardaddy kicks
          him. Reloads his rifle.

          Wardaddy aims his weapon - BRDDT! - Ends the boy's short
          lived war. He returns to the Fury. BANGS on Norman's hatch
          with his gun butt.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)

          Wardaddy gestures at Lt. Parker's burning tank.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           See what a kid can do? That's your fault.
           Next fucking German with a weapon you
           see, rake the dogshit out of him. I don't

          Wardaddy walks away leaving Norman destroyed and guilt
          wracked. Gordo looks at him, SEES he's falling apart.
                         
                          GORDO
           Okay. Look. That stupid kid did that not
           you. I froze up before too. That's why I
           like driving. You gotta kill Krauts? It's

          He offers Norman a bottle of wine. Norman declines. Wardaddy
          shouts to Sgt. Davis' tank.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Alright, Roy. Guess I'm it. I'll lead the

           SGT. DAVIS
           Lead the way.
                         
          Wardaddy climbs into the Fury's turret. Double checks his
          map. Into his mic:
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Move out, Driver.

          are laid across the hood of a Jeep. Nearby a couple GUNNERS

          distant German positions.
                         
          Wardaddy's four tanks are in a row. The tank crews prepare

           get hit by an ice wagon.

           I'm from the city too. Chicago. And I
           seen lots of animals die. Papa worked in
           a slaughterhouse cutting up steers with
           an electric saw. Came up from Mexico to
           work there. Papa would cut off a piece of
           meat, swipe some kidneys or a tongue and
           sneak 'em home. We ate beef every day. I
           started me there when I was fourteen. On
           the kill line. Hitting beef cows, old
           dairy cows, sometimes horses, between the
           eyes with a twelve pound sledgehammer.
           Right here.
           (taps his forehead)
           I'd be head to toe in blood, brains, and
           snot. Whackin' beefs all day until I
           couldn't move my arms.

           I helped in my dad's stationary store. At
           the register. We sold sundries. Nothing
           that bled or screamed.
                         
                          GORDO
           Too bad. It's something. The kill line
           teaches you something.

          Croon-Ass and Wardaddy are alone in the turret. Coon-Ass is
          crying. His nerves are getting the best of him.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Don, I can't do it. I can't take any
           more. I don't want to die. I feel like
           I'm going to slide right out of my skin
           every time a goddamn shell goes off. I
           can't do this. I don't got the nerve.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           You can do it. You get worked up. Before
           an action. That's all.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           This ain't that. This is something
           different.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           No it's your regular bullshit. You get
           the jitters. You bitch some and then
           you're fine. Grady, it's your way.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Lookit the odds. We got four years of
           close calls. All the original boys are
           gone. Dead or mangled. We're it. Me, you
           and the Mexican. Out of how many? Some
           guys have been replaced four or five
           times. Replacement shows up one day. He's
           dead the next. Why not us?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Shut up. Shut your mouth. Don't you spook
           that kid any more than he's already
           spooked. We need him.

           I remember.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           And his tank got hit by a Tiger and he
           bailed out and was running and a cannon
           shell hit him square in the back and he
           disappeared but his head flew straight up
           and landed in a tree. You remember that?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I said I remember.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Every night I dream his head's in a tree
           singing to me. Soft and sweet like my
           mama's songs when I was a baby. If I
           close my eyes right now, I'll see him.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Red's got us all a little sad right now.
           Grady. Look at my eyes, I'm talking. We
           gotta help this outfit. Then, you can get
           shit-yer-pants drunk and fuck some girls
           or something. How's that sound?
                         
                          COON-ASS
           You gonna drink with me?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           You know I won't do that. I'm the
           foulest meanest damn drunk you can
           imagine. I'd stab you in the face and
           lick the blade clean.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Fine. I'll drink that nice Cognac we
           found and roll around with some Nazi
           split-tails. I'm an ass man you know.
           Wish I had a stick of butter.
                         
          Wardaddy smiles. Coon-Ass is ready to fight.

          Wardaddy does a final walk around his four tanks. He sees
          both man and machine are ready for battle. He turns to the
          two waiting INFANTRY SQUADS - About 20 men.

          The tired dogfaces climb aboard the tanks. Wardaddy climbs
          aboard the Fury. Plugs in his helmet.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Start 'em up and move out.
                         
          The tanks start their engines and pull out. Each tank has at
          least five soldiers riding on top.

          The four tanks move in a column. Shielded from the enemy by a
          small low hill. Fury leads the way - An OLD SERGEANT standing
          behind the turret mans the .50 Cal.

          Soldiers spill off the tanks and take a knee. Close to the
          front line they stay low and wary. Some of the older salts
          immediately start digging foxholes.

          The tanks churn up dirt as they enter the field. Spread out
          in the field is a PLATOON OF AMERICAN INFANTRY, laying in
          shallow trenches they scraped into the dirt between the
          furrows. They are pinned down by German machine guns.
          Several are wounded or dead.

           Start squirting them trees and bushes.
                         
          The tanks fire their MACHINE GUNS - Streams of TRACERS from
          the four tanks probe at any possible hiding place for German

          and ricochets sharply. All four tanks begin to fire at the
          cannon's position.
                         
          KABOOM-KABOOM-KABOOM! Round after round detonates in quick

          It is too late - Two of them are crushed. The third man
          cringes at the bottom of the deep hole. Gordo stops over him.

          Soon the German dead have all be adequately "double tapped"

          dozens of pissed off American troops. Dark unshaven faces.
          Eyes burning with fever and exhaustion.
                         
          The Old Sergeant makes a throat cutting motion. The Platoon
          Soldier is about to shoot the German Corporal...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Hang on.
                         
          Wardaddy yanks Norman out of his hatch. Holds him by the
          neck, he frogmarches him over to the German Corporal. Who has
          pictures of his wife and kids in his hand.
                         
                          GERMAN CORPORAL
           Meine kinder! Meine frau!
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Halt die Fresse!
                         
          Wardaddy slaps the pictures from the man's hands. He pulls
          the .45 from his shoulder holster and hands it to Norman.
          Wardaddy spins the prisoner and kicks him to the dirt. Norman
          looking at the big pistol.
                         
          Bible watching this unfold from the Fury's turret. Gordo
          watches from the driver's hatch. Coon-Ass stops tossing out
          fired cannon shells to watch too.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           You're no goddamned good to me if you
           can't kill Krauts. Put a big fat hole in
           his back.
                         
          Some of the Platoon soldiers pause and watch the show. Others
          drift away and continue searching dead Germans. There is
          simply no way Norman can shoot this sobbing father in the
          back. He looks at Wardaddy with defiance.
                         
                          NORMAN
           No. I'm not doing it.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Why the hell not?
                         
                          NORMAN
           It's not right.

          He hands the pistol back. Wardaddy looks like he's going to
          hit Norman with it. Instead he holsters it. And walks away.
                         
          Then Wardaddy pauses. Thinks to himself: "Fuck this, I'll win
          this round." He strides back over to Norman. Grabs him by the
          throat and shoves him to his knees. He holds his .45 To
          Norman's head.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           We ain't here for right and wrong. We're
           here to kill these people.
                         
          Platoon Soldiers gather to watch - this is getting
          interesting. Wardaddy cocks the hammer.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           You or him. Your pick. You or him.
                         
                          NORMAN
           Do it. Kill me.
                         
          Norman has called his bluff. Enraged, Wardaddy forces the
          gun into Norman's - then wrestles the pistol against the back
          of the German Corporal's neck, who is falling apart sobbing.
                         
                          GERMAN CORPORAL
           Nicht shiesen! Bitte! Nich shiessen!
                         
          Wardaddy crams Norman's finger onto the trigger guard and
          mashes it against the trigger.
                         
          BAM! The pistol fires. Into the German's brain stem. Killing
          him instantly. Norman sags in defeated horror. Wardaddy
          holsters his pistol and walks away. Leaving Norman on his
          knees in the mud.
                         
          A HUGE DIRTY SOLDIER steps in and rolls the dead German
          Corporal over - He takes his watch and wedding ring. Bible
          walks over to Norman. He helps the kid up.
                         
                          BIBLE
           C'mon.
                         
          Leads back to the Fury. Where Coon-Ass hands Norman a hot cup
          of coffee. Norman accepts it gratefully. Wardaddy is by
          himself smoking a cigarette, maybe feeling a little guilty.
                         
                          NORMAN
           That was a shit show. Was that supposed
           to make a man out of me? My conscience is
           clean. I'm keeping it that way.
                         
          The Fury crews trade looks. They've all been there. Gordo
          puts a brotherly arm around Norman.

                          NORMAN
           He's the biggest asshole I ever met, and

           one else did.
                         
          A kind word. Norman needed it. The crew is starting to accept
          him.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           First time we got shot at in North
           Africa, Don shit his drawers. Stunk the
           tank up real good.
                         
          Norman looks at Wardaddy. Unable to imagine him ever afraid.
                         
          EXT. ROAD INTO TOWN - DAY
                         
          Wardaddy's four tanks lead the men and vehicles of Baker
          Company to their next objective. Infantry Soldiers ride on
          the tanks, ten or more on each. They are followed by several
          HALF-TRACKS.
                         
          Norman's hatch is open. He looks across at Gordo - who gives
          him a reassuring nod.
                         
          UP IN THE SKY - Flying at 30,000 feet is a massive formation
          of nearly a 1000 B-17 bombers! A white band of contrails
          covers the sky. The formation is several miles long. An
          astounding vision. Around the bomber formation are the
          corkscrewing contrails of fighters engaged in dogfights.
                         
          Norman watching this entranced. The other tankers and
          soldiers are enthralled by the spectacle. Wardaddy watches
          the bombers with admiration...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           There you go, boys. Keep pounding them.
                         
          There is a bright flash and a bomber falls out of the sky.
                         
          The tankers and soldiers watch the distant bomber spin slowly
          towards the ground like a giant falling maple seed.

          The column of men and machines continues up the road. They
          pass two mangled German Army Horse-drawn Wagons. Shattered by
          fighter plane rockets, a twisted tangle of dead German
          soldiers and horses. An OLD WOMAN is hacking off hunks of
          horseflesh. She glares at the Americans with pure hate.
                         
                          GORDO
           There you go, kid. She's sure as shit
           fuck you for a chocolate bar.
                         
          Norman looking at Gordo. Scandalized by that. Then, he cracks
          a smile at the sheer absurdity - Norman is starting to become
          a frontline soldier.
                         
          EXT. OUTSIDE A GERMAN TOWN - DAY
                         
          The column has halted. The four tanks are spread out abreast.
          The Infantry Soldiers have dismounted from the tanks and take
          shelter behind them.
                         
          Wardaddy scans the town with German binoculars. His jaw
          muscles ripple as he grinds his teeth.

          The four tanks move forward toward the town. Love 1-3 and
          Love 1-4 leave the road and split off around either side of
          the village. The tanks move slow- - so the Platoon Soldiers
          on foot can keep up.

          POW! A single rifle shot hits the Old Man, dropping him
          instantly. Wardaddy grabs the handles of his .50 Cal and lets
          it rip on the Hotel building.
                         
          RAT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT! Thumbsized armor piercing bullets
          smash into the Hotel. Blasting off chunks of masonry.

          BOOM! The round EXPLODES dropping most of the second story
          facade - exposing 6 GERMAN SOLDIERS, stunned by the blast.
                         
          POW-POW-POW-POW-POW! The Platoon Soldiers crouched behind the

          BRDDDDDDDT! Dropping the German to the street. His rifle
          CLATTERS across the cobblestones.
                         
          Norman realizes that he did. He leans back and takes a deep

          BRDDDDT! A German heavy machine gun opens up. It is cleverly
          dug into a cellar in the base of a building. Its chainsaw
          roar echoes off the buildings. Its deadly tracers rake the
          street...
                         
          Two Platoon Soldiers are hit and drop - The Machine gun is
          too close to the Fury for the tank to get a good shot.

          EXT. GERMAN TOWN - DAY
                         
          Wardaddy opens his hatch, bricks cover the tank. A German
          Soldier staggers out of the exposed building. Bleeding from
          the ears and disoriented...
                         
          Wardaddy pulls his .45 and takes careful aim - POP! Drops him
          with one shot - Then out of nowhere:
                         
          BOOM-KTANG! A German anti-tank shell glances off the turret
          with a SHOWER OF SPARKS and smashes into the building.
                         
          Wardaddy is stunned by the close call. Wiping his eyes,
          choking on brick dust...
                         
          NEW ANGLE - A Small German antitank gun is hidden inside a
          tailor shop. The crew frantically reloading.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Antitank! Left! Fox Love! Phosphorous!
           Five zero! Fire when ready!
                         
          INT. FURY (MOVING)
                         
          We see the amazing skill of an experienced tank crew. Coon-
          Ass unloads the High Explosive shell in the breech and shoves
          in a SMOKE ROUND - Bible traverses the turret on the target.
          Gordo works the steering levers bringing the thick armor of
          the tank's front to face the enemy gun...
                         
          Norman joins in - Firing a long burst into the Tailor ship.
          His tracer rounds bouncing off the guns armor shield...
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TOWN
                         
          The Fury and her turret spin quickly - Lining up on the
          tailor shop.
                         
          KABOOM-POW! - The white phosphorous shell detonates inside.
          Explodes with a white burst of noxious smoke - Spraying
          burning phosphorous particles everywhere...
                         
          The four man GUN CREW flees into the street. Trailing white
          smoke - Phosphorous burning deep into their flesh.
                         
          BRDDDDDDDDDT! Norman mows them all down. All four men.
          Ending their misery.
                         
          CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PERISCOPE - We can see his eyes through the
          glass prism.

          Norman gawks through the periscope at their smoking corpses.
          It sinks in what he's done. He doesn't like it.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Gunner, put an HE in there. Smash that
           gun.
                         
          KABOOM-BOOM! The Fury fires a High Explosive shell into the
          Tailor Shop. Not taking any chances. The Fury continues
          forward. Its steel tracks CLANKING on the cobblestones of the
          tiny farming village. Love 1-5 follows close behind FIRING
          BURSTS OF TRACERS into upper story windows.
                         
          The Platoon Soldiers filter through the buildings behind
          them. Checking for enemy soldiers. Small teams of soldiers
          leapfrogging up the street. All business. Unhurried and
          cautious.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TOWN - CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
                         
          The Fury and Love 1-5 enter the square and spread out. Each
          covering their respective sides. A door opens...
                         
          Wardaddy swings his .50 Cal on an older man waving a white
          pillowcase - He's the town BURGERMEISTER. White sheets
          suddenly appear from several windows. The Burgermeister
          cautiously approaches the Fury.
                         
                          BURGERMEISTER
                          (IN GERMAN)
           Please. Stop shooting. The remaining
           soldiers wish to surrender. I am trying
           to save my village. The people have
           suffered so much.
                         
                          WARDADDY
                          (IN GERMAN)
           Thank your buddy Hitler for that. Where
           are the German soldiers? How many are
           there and what weapons do they have?
                         
                          BURGERMEISTER
                          (IN GERMAN)
           They are in the bank. There are thirty.
           They are not soldiers. They are children.
           The SS made them fight.
                         
          He points at a DEAD TEENAGER hanging from a lamppost with
          another of those damn signs "I am a coward"

           You tell them to come out with their
           hands held high and empty.
                          (INTO RADIO)
           All tanks, hold your fire until I say so.
           I got the mayor here and I think they're
           surrendering. Binkowski load an HE and
           get ready to put it in that bank if these
           people want to test us.
                         
          Wardaddy nods for the Burgermeister to go ahead. He crosses
          to the bank, under dozens of watchful American weapons.
          Wardaddy scanning the area for threats. It's tense.
                         
          The Burgermeister SHOUTS for the soldiers to come out.
                         
          AT THE BANK - The front doors open. A line of dejected kids
          emerges in eclectic uniforms. BOYS and GIRLS. Their hands
          held high, faces scared.
                         
          The Platoon Soldiers surge forward and search them. Among
          them is an SS OFFICER, his arm in a sling. Wardaddy points
          him out to the Burgermeister.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
                          (IN GERMAN)
           Is he the man who has been hanging the
           children?
                         
          The Burgermeister looks nervous - The SS Officer is glaring
          right at him. Nevertheless, the Burgermeister nods: Yes.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Hey! Shoot that guy! Yeah, him. The SS
           cocksucker with the busted wing.
                         
          Without hesitation, a young SKINNY SOLDIER pulls the SS
          Officer from the line, aims his Tommy gun at him and...
                         
          BRDDDDDT! Stitches the hardened Nazi from crotch to throat.
          The Burgermeister gives Wardaddy a grateful nod.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TOWN - CENTRAL SQUARE
                         
          LATER - The Company vehicles have joined the tanks. With the
          day's work over for them, Baker Company's SOLDIERS swarm over
          the town, searching houses, collecting weapons.
                         
          SOLDIERS stack the dead Germans. MEDICS treat the wounded. A
          SOLIDER drags a mattress down the street. Another sits in a
          big stuffed chair on the sidewalk smoking a cigar.

          Bible scoops helmet-fulls of empty machine gun brass out of
          the turret. Gordo sleeps under the tank. Coon-Ass boils water
          in his helmet over a fire of made of broken chair legs.
                         
          Norman stands outside the Fury trying to comprehend what he
          has seen. Wardaddy approaches him. Offers his hand. Norman
          shakes. Wary of this volatile veteran.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           It wasn't nothing right?
                         
                          NORMAN

           Rubbing out them Heinies. You splashed
           'em real good. Wasn't nothing right?
                         
          Norman looks at Wardaddy - realizes he NEEDS Norman to agree
          with him - To agree it's nothing to kill people. As if
          Norman can give Wardaddy absolution for all the men he's
          killed. Norman lies and tells him what he wants to hear.
                         
                          NORMAN
           Sure, Sergeant. It wasn't nothing. In
           face, I kinda liked it.
                         
          Norman is a bad liar. Wardaddy thinks for a moment. Then:
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I want you to see something.
                         
          Wardaddy leads Norman down the street - to the front door of
          the local NAZI PARTY HEADQUARTERS.
                         
          INT. GERMAN - NAZI HEADQUARTERS - DAY
                         
          Wardaddy pushes the door open. He and Norman gaze upon a
          shocking sight...
                         
          WHAT THEY SEE - There are several dead men and women. The men
          wear Nazi Party uniforms, middle-aged fat bureaucrats. The
          women wear party dresses. Presumably their wives. Empty booze
          bottles everywhere. Several of the men hold pistols.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           They knew we were coming. So they got
           drunk as Lords and shot themselves at sun
           up.
                         
          A beat as Norman stares at this mad tableau...

          EXT. GERMAN TOWN - CENTRAL SQUARE
                         
          Wardaddy and Norman head down the street. Two GIs pass them
          clutching wine bottles - both wear top hats and sunglasses.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Keep doing what I say. You do that and

          CRASH! - SOLDIERS searching a building heave a dumpster out
          the window. It bursts open on the cobblestone street.
                         
          Wardaddy SEES a face in the window on the upper floor of a
          nearby apartment building. He quickly heads for =it.

          Wardaddy grabs Norman's greasegun - cocks it and hands it
          back. He takes the safety off his assault rifle and boots the
          front door.

          Norman follows. They reach an apartment door on the top
          story. Wardaddy POUNDS it with the stock of his assault
          rifle. A WOMAN opens the door - Her name is IRMA - The fear
          on her face is plain as day.

          It has surprisingly modern furniture and decor. Wardaddy
          quickly searches the place. Norman follows him around like a
          puppy. Wardaddy checks closets. Cupboards. Anywhere a human
          being can hide. He enters a bedroom and looks under the bed -
          SOMEONE is hiding underneath.

          Norman watches a gorgeous young lady slide out from under the
          bed. This is EMMA - she's 18 - Norman's age. Wardaddy helps
          her up. Norman is transfixed by her.
                         
          Wardaddy drags Emma from the bedroom by her wrist. Wardaddy
          turns to Norman.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Close the door and lock it.
                         
          Norman freezes - Things are going to a bad place.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Lock the fucking door!
                         
          Norman complies. Slowly closing and locking the front door.
          Irma is just sick with fear.

                          (GERMAN)
           - I know what you were afraid of.

          Wardaddy pushes Emma onto the couch. Then sits down in a
          chair. He takes off his helmet. Leans his rifle against the
          wall. Suddenly looking very tired. He looks at Irma.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
                          (GERMAN)
           Get me some hot water. For shaving.
                          (TO NORMAN)
           Sit the fuck down. Put the gun away. You
           make me nervous.
                         
          Norman stiffly sits on the couch with Emma. It's awkward.
          Like a bad blind date.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
                          (GERMAN)
           What's your name young lady?
                         
                          EMMA
           Emma.
                         
                          WARDADDY
                          (GERMAN)
           Emma, you know how to cook?
                         
          The girl nods: yes. Wardaddy reaches in his musette bag. Digs
          out a soap dish. He opens it and carefully unwraps four eggs -
          Precious rare eggs.
                         
          Then he takes out a can of coffee. And a can of bacon. He
          offers the rare treasures to Emma. Her eyes light up and she
          joyfully accepts them. As a bonus Wardaddy gives her two
          packs of smokes. She happily joins Irma in the kitchen.
                         
          Norman relaxes. Wardaddy isn't here to rape and kill them.
          Norman takes off his helmet. And takes off his jacket.
                         
          INT. GERMAN TOWN - WOMAN'S APARTMENT
                         
          In the kitchen - Irma savoring an American cigarette as she
          cooks bacon and eggs. She sips from her cup of fresh coffee.
          The first in years.
                         
          Norman is asleep on the couch. Wardaddy stands before a pot
          of steaming hot water. He has peeled off his jacket, overalls
          and shirt - Hideous burn scars cover his back.
                         
          Emma crosses to Norman and gently wakes him, offers him a
          steaming cup of coffee. Norman smiles at her. He likes her.
          She smiles back. She likes him. She sits next to him. Thigh
          to thigh.
                         
          Norman SEES Wardaddy's burns and REACTS - Embarrassed by
          them, Wardaddy puts his shirt back on.

          Emma holds Norman's hand. Then tries to pull him off the
          couch. Norman realizes where this is going. And blushes. He
          shakes his head: no.
                         
          Wardaddy slides a fresh blade in his safety razor.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           She's a good clean girl. You don't take
           her in that bedroom, I will.
                         
          Emma intuits what Wardaddy has said and clings to Norman's
          arm.
                         
          Norman looks at Wardaddy. At the girl. Wardaddy doesn't
          really want her. But Norman doesn't know that. Norman makes
          his decision. He leads Emma into the bedroom. She shuts the
          door behind them.
                         
          Wardaddy smiles. Like a proud big brother. He works up a good
          lather with his shaving brush.
                         
          NEW ANGLE - Irma steps out of the kitchen, arms crossed, with
          a disapproving look.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
                          (GERMAN)
           They're young. And they're alive.
                         
          He carefully scrapes off the dirt and whiskers with the sharp
          razor. Irma stands there smoking, watching him shave. It's
          nice having a man in the house.
                         
                          IRMA
                          (GERMAN)
           You speak good German.

                          (GERMAN)
           I know.
                         
          He's not interested in her. She was hoping he was. She
          returns to the kitchen.

          Coon-Ass has been waiting impatiently inside the Fury.
          Finally Gordo exits the tank turret, buttoning his trousers
          with a satisfied look.
                         
                          GORDO
           Batter up.
                         
          Coon-Ass climbs into the tank. Bible looks on disapprovingly.

          Gordo grabs a wine bottle. Takes a swig.
                         
                          GORDO
           Where's Wardaddy? Daddy? Where you

          Bible nods toward the Apartment Building.

          IN THE BEDROOM - Norman has her hand in his, he's reading her
          palm.
                         
                          NORMAN
           This is the ring of Solomon. You help
           people. And understand them. It's really
           rare. See mine? I got it too.
                         
          He shows her his hand. Then continues her reading...
                         
                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           This is your heart line. You're going to
           have one great love in your life. My
           grandma taught me how to do this. People
           came from all over to see her. Okay, this
           is your life line...
                         
          Norman pauses. Looks at her. It's not good news.
                         
          She sees the change in him. Decides to lighten the mood.
          Emma peels top off. Norman's eyes lock on her breasts. She's
          proud of them, as she should be. With the ice broken, Norman
          makes his move and kisses her. She takes his pants off. He's
          shy. She likes that.
                         
                          EMILY
                          (GERMAN)
           Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt
           you.
                         
                          NORMAN
           I don't know what you're saying.
                         
          Emma shushes him with a finger. She rolls him on his back and
          mounts him.

          WHORE. Pig fucking is a better description. Pure mindless

          Irma singing in German as she works in the kitchen. Norman
          exits the bedroom. Looking flushed and content. Wardaddy, now
          cleaned up, is a different man. Norman sits on the couch.
          Gathering his thoughts.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           You don't need to say nothing.
                         
          They sit there in silence. Wardaddy sipping his coffee. Emma
          exits the bedroom. Glowing. She joins Irma in the kitchen who
          quietly scolds her.
                         
          BANGING at the door. Wardaddy nods for Norman to get it. The
          women peer around the corner, frightened.
                         
          Norman opens the door - It's Coon-Ass, Gordo, and Bible. The
          three men enter. Take off their helmets. Set down their
          weapons. Coon-Ass and Gordo are drunk.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Boy, it's time for you to act the man. We
           got you fixed up good. A special gal's
           down there waiting for you.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           You're too late.
                         
          Emma brings the new arrivals glasses of beer. Coon-Ass drools
          over the beautiful young woman. She returns quickly to the
          kitchen.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Bless your heart, boy. You took that
           pretty thing for a roll?
                         
          Norman won't answer him. And that's answer enough.
                         
                          COON-ASS (CONT'D)

          Coon-Ass smiles. Rubs Wardaddy's smooth face.

           Sissy bastard.
                         
          Coon-Ass regards a photograph on the wall. A young man in
          Army uniform. He takes it down, dismayed.

          the picture at Irma...

          Wardaddy appears behind Coon-Ass and takes the photo from
          him. He gently hands it to Irma.

          Norman is touched by this respectful side of Wardaddy. Coon-
          Ass sits down. Pulls a bottle from his jacket and takes a
          swig. Coon-Ass hands it to Norman. And stares at him with
          angry bloodshot eyes...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           You best take a bite.
                         
          Norman hesitates, then takes a swig. Winces from the burn.

          outside. Emma and Irma trade scared looks.
                         
          Norman gets up and looks out the window...

          load of Reichsmarks and tosses them in the air.

           In France we hit the beach right after D-
           Day and fought through all those fucking
           hedgerows. We finally broke out into open
           country. And bypassed all these Kraut
           divisions. We linked up with the
           Canadians and British and trapped an
           entire Kraut Army pulling back to
           Germany. We fucked them up. With planes
           and artillery. Dead Krauts and horses and
           busted up tanks and cars for miles.
           Miles. Your eyes see it but your head
           can't make no sense of it. We go in

           there. And for three whole days we shot
           wounded horses. All day long. Sun up to
           sundown. Putting down horses. Hot summer
           days. Ain't smelled nothing like it. The
           sound of it. Those fucking horses
           screaming. Black clouds of flies buzzing.
           Like being in a giant bee hive.
                         
          Norman's eyes bug. He's lost his appetite.

           It's what happened. And what happened
           happened. And what's gonna happen is
           gonna happen. And playing house with a

          Wardaddy pulls his .45 And SLAMS it on the table. Coon-Ass
          backs down. A painfully tense silence follows. Wardaddy's
          fork scrapes against his plate as he shovels eggs and bacon
          into his mouth. Finally he looks at Norman. Smiles warmly.

                          NORMAN
           She doesn't fry chicken. She roasts it
           with stuffing. Or makes chicken and
           dumplings. That's my favorite. She bakes
           too. Pies and cakes and --

          The men look at each other. Their short respite is over.
          Wardaddy finishes his coffee. Pushes his chair back and
          stands. His men stand too.

          Irma stands stoically. Hands folded in front of her. Lips
          pursed. Norman grabs his greasegun. Slips on his helmet. It's
          hateful to leave. Just hateful. Emma runs to him and holds on
          to him for dear life. Coon-Ass grabs the boy by the scruff

          Inside a nice house with antiques and Persian rugs. Captain
          Waggoner goes over a map with Wardaddy.
                         
                          CAPTAIN WAGGONER
           Grasshopper spotted a troop concentration
           moving west. Higher wants your armor

                          CAPTAIN WAGGONER
           Enough to spook the Colonel. Road march
           to the crossroads and secure them. Don't
           for anything. Take my gas if you need it.
                         
          Wardaddy looks at the map, makes some notes in a notebook.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Alright, sir. I'm on my way.
                         
          Suddenly there is a loud WHISTLING of incoming German
          Artillery - Wardaddy, the Captain, the RADIOMEN and COMPANY
          CLERKS hit the deck...
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TOWN - CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
                         
          A group of SOLDIERS plays blackjack on a blanket. Gambling
          for piles of watches and jewelry. Norman and Gordo pouring
          gas into the Fury.
                         
          BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-KABOOM! - German artillery shells explode
          all around them. Bible drops into the turret, closes the
          hatch. Gordo slides off the tank and crawls underneath.
          Norman follows. Coon-Ass already there. A grinning fool.
                         
                          GORDO

           town for all I care.
                         
          BOOM! A large shell strikes Irma's apartment building,
          collapsing the front. Then everything is obscured by dust and
          smoke...

          the little village. Buildings burn. Others have collapses.
          THE APARTMENT BUILDING is heavily damaged.
                         
          A SOLDIER crawls along the street crying for his mama, his
          legs are missing, just two stumps trailing blood.
                         
          Norman runs to the apartment building - At the smoking rubble
          pile that was its facade moments before. He stops in his
          tracks and looks up...
                         
          WHAT NORMAN SEES - Irma's shattered body hanging from a
          splintered mass of wood floorboards...
                         
          Next Norman SEES Emma is crushed and mixed into the rubble.
          She's gasping for her last breath...
                         
          Norman shakes off the blow and starts to dig out Emma,
          desperate, frantic - Coon-Ass grabs him and drags him away.

          Norman starts throwing punches. Coon-Ass lets him vent,
          easily blocking them.
                         
                          COON-ASS (CONT'D)

           What the fuck is wrong with you!? What
           the fuck is wrong with everyone? Nobody
           cares about anything. What the fuck is
           happening?
                         
          Bored with being punched, Coon-Ass throws Norman to the
          ground. Kicks him in the ass.

          The four tank engines ROAR to life. Wardaddy does a quick
          check of the Fury's tracks. Norman sits in the BOW seat.
          Tears streak his dusty face. Gordo looks at him. Sympathetic.

          He shakes the Captain's hand. SCHWACK! A sniper's bullet rips
          out the Captain's throat, dropping him on the spot.

           of here.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TOWN - CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
                         
          The four tanks of 1st Platoon Love Company pull out for their
          next mission. Wardaddy leads the way in the Fury.
                         
          They are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse - Leaving behind
          a town transformed. Blood in the streets. Stacks of dead.
          Burning buildings. Piles of rubble.
                         
          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
                         
          Open flat farm country. The occasional farm building. The
          column of four tanks moves fast. Wardaddy keys the intercom.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Norman. Get your ass up here.
                         
          Norman looks at Wardaddy. Who waves for him to join him.
          Norman carefully climbs out of his hatch. And picks his way
          across the moving tank. Wardaddy pats the big .50 Cal machine
          gun.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Why don't you sit up here for a bit and
           run this baby.
                         
          Norman grabs the spade grips and stands behind the turret.
          His face is angry stone. Wardaddy seems relaxed. Almost
          enjoying the beautiful country. He looks at Norman.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           I know how you feel.
                         
                          NORMAN
           You have no idea how I feel.

           Today... Look, what happened back there.
           Is every day. It's every day.
                         
                          NORMAN
           Today's the worst day of my life.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Like I said, that's every day. If you
           think it can't get worse, it can. And it
           will. I started this war killing Germans
           in Africa. Then France. Then Belgium. Now
           I'm killing Germans in Germany. It will
           end. Soon too. But before it does a lot
           more people gotta die.
                         
          Wardaddy points out a massive column of black smoke in the
          distance. The herald of destruction on an unbelievable level.
          It is the death of a city.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           See that? That's a whole city on fire. I
           bet that's where those bombers were
           heading. The dying ain't done. The
           killing ain't done.
                         
          Norman tries to understand the enormity of what he is
          witnessing. He can't. They ride in silence for a beat.
                         
                         THEN:
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           My mother was born near here. I think
           right there in that city burning to the
           ground. I got no problem killing my kin.
                         
                          NORMAN
           How'd you get all burnt up?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           My back?
                         
                          NORMAN
           Germans did it? That why you hate them so
           much?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           No. I did it. Before the war. Before the
           Army. I had a beautiful girl I was gonna
           marry. Rose. She made me feel like a
           fucking king. Pretty like one of those
           old paintings. She was good. A good
           person. She had a good heart.

          does...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           I drank then. I'd get asshole drunk and
           Rose hated it. There was a dance in town.
           With a band from Wichita. I had her old
           man's truck. My little brother came with
           us. He was sixteen. And looked just like
           you. With the same "I'm smarter than
           everyone else around me" expression you
           got. And he was. Book smart and people
           smart. A good kid. Well I drank two
           bottles of nickel whisky and got in a
           punch-up at the dance with this big
           Indian. K.O.ed him with a bottle.
                         
                          NORMAN
           I'm not your bartender and I'm not your
           pastor. You don't need to tell me this.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           And I ain't your friend. You're listening
           'cause someone has to hear. The sheriff
           got called so I shoved Rose and my
           brother in the truck and drove off like
           my hair was on fire. Yep, like a real
           shithead. Pedal to the mat. Hit an ice
           patch and flipped it. I got thrown and
           ended up under it. The engine right on my
           back, cooked me like Sunday's beef roast.
           Rose and my brother got their necks
           broken. Whole county hated me for it. I
           got the chain gang. I laid roadbeds.
           Worked cotton. Mule teams. War started
           and the Judge told me to die for my
           country. Best advice I ever got.
                         
          Norman looks out on the German countryside. Then at Wardaddy.
          Despite his age, Norman has a strong, quiet wisdom.
                         
                          NORMAN
           Does it matter now? Does it matter here?

           I don't disagree. Been with these fine

           they don't know none of this. Not a word

           A caul. A birth shroud around my head. So
           I see things. Sometimes I know things are
           going to happen. And people tell me
           things. Since I was little. Bad things.

          Norman REACTS - Not to Wardaddy - But to the terribly thin
          corpses filling the ditches on either side of the road. They
          wear the infamous striped pajamas of the camp system. They
          were shot after collapsing during a forced march.

          A HUNDRED CIVILIANS dig a tank ditch through a couple
          farmer's fields. They stop working and stare in awe as
          Wardaddy's four tanks race right past them on the unblocked
          road.

          Davis are on their bellies at the top of the hill studying
          the shallow valley below with binoculars.
                         
          A couple miles away is the CROSSROADS the tanks are to
          protect. A few farm buildings dot the landscape. It is

          more tanks, now just burning wrecks. He watches the Tiger
          burn for a moment, his jaw grinding.
                         
          Sgt. Davis' tank pulls alongside the Fury. He's scared.

          The barn is a hundred yards away. Sgt. Davis heads to it in
          his tank, Love 1-3. He stops outside the barn doors.
                         
          Wardaddy scans the area with his binoculars - Not a threat in

          KA-WHAM! It is a violent and shattering detonation, the

          The cannon rips the sandbags off the front of the Fury,
          missing anything vital. The Fury is backing up...
                         
          The Tiger realizes what is afoot - It starts turning in the

          The ammunition inside EXPLODES. The Tiger shudders to a

          flame. The DRIVER tries to escape. But the flames are too
          intense. He's incinerated right before Wardaddy's eyes...

          Norman sags in his seat, exhausted by the tension. Wardaddy
          drops inside the turret. Grabs the radio mic - Realizes the
          radios are trashed...

          Coon-Ass lights a smoke with shaking hands. Gordo wipes the
          grit from face with a sleeve.

                          COON-ASS
           Quit? Quit?! Boy, we get a dollar
           thirty five a day plus free chow and

           vacation. Best job I had.
                         
          Coon-Ass wasn't trying to be funny. He's shaken to his core.
          Wardaddy lets them vent. He passes Gordo a bottle of brandy.
          Gordo takes it and downs a long swig.
                         
          Wardaddy SEES Norman sitting there quietly. Covered with
          hydraulic oil and blood. Staring into space.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Having a good time, kid?
                         
          Norman looks at Wardaddy and shakes his head thinking "What
          the fuck is wrong with these people." Wardaddy smiles. He
          knows Norman will be okay.

           We got a job to do. We can sit here and

           those crossroads and bitch about it
           there. I don't see a hell of a lot of

           That's real inspiring. Shit, now I wanna

           off his throne by his balls.
                         
          Norman turns to Wardaddy and deadpans:
                         
                          NORMAN
           That's not really true. He just said it
           to be an asshole.
                         
          Norman just took the sarcasm to another level. The veteran
          tankers stare at Norman -- He is becoming one of them...

          The sun is setting. The Fury moves up the road approaching
          the rural tree lined intersection with an OLD HOUSE and a
          BEER HALL - There isn't a soul in sight.
                         
          Wardaddy scans the terrain with his binoculars. He's looking
          for a good spot to park the Fury for the night. The tank is
          moving through the intersection.
                         
          BOOM! - The Fury runs over a mine - The explosion lifts the
          tank and drops it. The broken left track falls off the drive
          wheel...

          Rations and ammunition spill from its racks. SPARKING
          electrical shorts.

          Gordo shakes it off. The engine stalls. He restarts it. Puts

          circle.

          Norman exits his hatch - He's afraid to jump down to the
          road...
                         
                          NORMAN
           What about mines?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           They're for vehicles. You ain't heavy
           enough to set one off. Go with Coon-Ass
           and check out those buildings. I'm
           covering you. Go on.
                         
          Norman looks at Coon-Ass, who shrugs. They approach the Old
          House just up the road...

          Both men freeze...
                         
          WHAT THEY SEE - The Interior of the house is filled with
          mines. Big round anti-tank mines to be exact. Stacks of them.
          It's being used as a munitions depot.
                         
          Coon-Ass slowly backs out of there...

          Gordo and Bible have started unbolting a section of track
          from Fury's side. Coon-Ass shouts to Wardaddy:
                         
                          COON-ASS
           Whole thing's full of mines. Good thing

          This place is disturbing in a different way. There is dried
          blood everywhere. Bandages. Medical supplies. Cut off bloody
          uniforms and boots. Amputated limbs. Flesh. Organs. And a
          half-dozen DEAD GERMAN SOLDIERS who succumbed to battle
          wounds. This was a temporary field hospital.

          breaking tool to remove the damaged track links. Bible probes
          the road around them for more mines.

          Norman sits in the roadside ditch. He checks his greasegun.
          It's loaded. He sets it in his lap.
                         
          He adds drink powder to his canteen. Shakes it. He opens a
          can of crackers with his little GI can opener. He chews the
          hard crackers and washes them down with his canteen.
                         
          He yawns widely. He's physically and emotionally drained from
          his first day as a US Army tanker.
                         
          After being in a tank he feels so alone and exposed out here.
          He HEARS something. Scared, he raises his ugly black weapon.
                         
          It's just an OWL in the trees. Norman relaxes. He can't keep
          his eyes open. His head falls toward his chest. His heavy
          eyelids close. And he falls asleep.

          he was shot. He checks himself for holes. And relaxes - It
          was just a dream...
                         
          He berates himself for falling asleep. He gets on his knees.
          To a less comfortable position.
                         
          Then he freezes. And his eyes grow wide.
                         
          WHAT NORMAN SEES - Moving toward him along the dark road is a
          long column of silhouettes.
                         
          GERMAN SOLDIERS - Marching toward him. A lot of them. More
          than he's ever seen. There are several hundred. And there's
          something about the way they move. These aren't shuffling
          demoralized conscripts. These are healthy, well equipped
          combat troops - And they are heading his way...
                         
          Norman thinks for a moment. He has to warn the others...
                         
          He gets low and slowly backs down the ditch...

          Gordo, Coon-Ass, and Bible work on repairing the track.
          Wardaddy sits in the turret, a deadly alert sentry with his
          big machine gun. He can't see the approaching men.
                         
          Here comes Norman at a full run...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Why good evening, Norman. Why aren't you
           at your post?

                          NORMAN
           The Germans.
                         
                          WARDADDY

           More than I can count.
                         
          Wardaddy climbs down from the turret.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I'm sure it's some bums looking for
           someone to surrender to.
                          (TO COON-ASS)
           Keep working. I'll be right back.
                         
          Wardaddy and Norman head up the road...
                         
          EXT. ROAD SENTRY POSITION - NIGHT
                         
          Wardaddy and Norman move low along the ditch. Wardaddy SEES
          the approaching troops - Silhouettes in the darkness. He can
          just hear their hobnailed boots CRUNCHING the road.
                         
          He grabs Norman's arm and drags him out of there.
                         
                          WARDADDY

                          WARDADDY
           There's a goddamned SS battalion headed

           Let's get out of here. They'll never see

                          WARDADDY
           We're not running. We're fighting it out.
           We'll hold this damn crossroad.
                         
          His men look at him like he's insane. This is unlike anything
          they have ever done.
                         
                          COON-ASS
           You wanna set here in a busted tank and

           No I don't want to. But it's what we're
           doing. Mount up. Take your fighting
           positions.
                         
          Wardaddy climbs aboard the Fury. His jaw tenses. It's okay
          with him. He double checks his .50 Cal.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Go on. Get outta here.
                         
          Norman looks at the other guys. Then at Wardaddy. He crosses
          to the Fury and stands by it, looking at the others with
          crossed arms.
                         
          With that show of bravery, Gordo, Coon-Ass, and Bible have no
          choice but to follow suit. The three men approach the Fury.
          No one has any illusions - This somber, sober choice means
          their deaths.
                         
          Wardaddy smiles. As much of a smile as he can muster. Then
          he's all business.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           We're gonna play dead, like we've done
           before. Let 'em march right up. Then open
           up with all we got and splatter the

          Wardaddy grabs his knife and cuts several packs and
          dufflebags off the tank. He hands Norman a gas can...

           Give 'em a good soaking.
                         
          Norman pours the gas on them. Gordo grabs extra boxes of ammo
          from the storage racks and shoves them into the tank.
                         
          Bible is in the turret singing a hymn. He resets the fuzes on
          the cannon shells for close-in work. He wipes the main gun
          breech down. Cleans his optics. Oils the machine gun.
                         
          Here comes Coon-Ass dragging a body...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Hurry up with that sack 'a shit.
                         
          Wardaddy jumps down to help. He tosses the body on the front
          of the tank. Pulls off his jacket and puts it on the body.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Toss me that helmet.
                         
          Norman tosses him an American helmet. Wardaddy straps it on
          the corpse's head. He grabs the gas can from Norman. Splashes
          the body with it. Wardaddy lights a smoke with a match. Then
          tosses the match on the body - FWOOMP!
                         
          Wardaddy lights another match and tosses it on the packs in
          the road - FWOOMP! Satisfied, he surveys his work.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Now they ain't gonna see nothing but a

           Button up.
                         
          The men slip into the Fury and close the hatches. It looks
          like a bigger shit pile than when we first saw it, bathed in
          the firelight of the burning packs and the German corpse.
          Debris scattered around it, a broken track...

          Wardaddy pulls out a bottle of French Cognac. He opens it.
          Stares at it like it's the very gates of Hell. Bible is
          mortified Wardaddy is considering drinking it.

          Wardaddy pours the booze in his mouth, it splashes down his
          cheeks. Norman watching him - If he didn't know they weren't
          going to live through this he does now.

           I know you hate me preaching, but what
           we're doing is a righteous act. There's a
           bible verse I think about sometimes. Then
           I heard the voice of the Lord saying,

          Wardaddy puts on asbestos gloves and wrestles it from its

          EXT. CROSSROADS - FURY - NIGHT
                         
          The smoke grenades gush torrents of dense yellow smoke.
                         
          Gordo opens his hatch - Fires his Tommy-gun at anywhere he
          thinks a German is hiding...
                         
          Next to him, the muzzle of Norman's machine gun spits fire
          lead and tracers into the night...
                         
          Wardaddy scrambles over the turning turret. To the rack of
          .30 Cal ammo boxes.
                         
          Gordo firing and reloading his Tommy gun...
                         
          BRDDDDT! - Bible fires the last of his ammo. He climbs up
          through Wardaddy's hatch and grabs the grips of the big .50
          heavy machine gun and lets it rip...
                         
          RAT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT! - He's chopping down a row of trees
          where a cluster of SS Troopers fires at the Fury.
                         
          It is a scene of inexpressibly wicked beauty - The hot orange
          light of the blazing buildings. Bright white and pink tracers
          slash the air. Bullets spark against tank steel. Dead and
          dying SS Troops in a haze of psychedelic yellow smoke.
          Running shadows. The sharp bright FLASHES of German hand
          grenades. And the noise! GUNFIRE, SCREAMING, SHOUTING.
                         
          At the center of it all - Wardaddy pulls several boxes of
          ammo from the turret's external racks and pitches them into
          the open hatch...
                         
          He HEARS A SCREAM - A FANATICAL SS TROOPER emerges from the
          wall of yellow smoke - Charging and firing his MP40 machine
          gun...

          THWICK! - Wardaddy is hit in the arm. Wardaddy aims, fires
          back...
                         
          BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! Dropping the SS bastard. Wardaddy grabs
          Bible's shoulder - Banging away with the .50 Cal - Shouts in
          his ear...
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Get in! Get inside!
                         
          Bible dives through the hatch. With bullets hitting all
          around. Wardaddy climbs inside the Fury.
                         
          Gordo empties his magazine - BRDDDDT! - Drops inside the
          tank. CLANGING the hatch shut behind him.
                         
          The yellow smoke is clearing -- Several SS TROOPERS run PAST
          CAMERA...
                         
          INT. CROSSROADS - FURY - NIGHT
                         
          Bible reloads his coax gun. Wardaddy passes boxes of ammo to
          Gordo as Norman loads a fresh belt into his gun. Wardaddy
          back at his periscope looking for targets.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           We got eight boxes of ammo. For per gun.
           Make it last.
                         
                          BIBLE
           You're hit.
                         
          Wardaddy looks at his arm and shrugs.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           So are you.
                         
          That's when Bible realizes blood is running down his neck.
          His scalp got nicked with a bullet.
                         
          Gordo pulls the pin out of a grenade. Quickly opens his hatch
          and tosses it outside.
                         
          Norman concentrates on his periscope, walking his tracers
          onto the darting shadows outside - Gordo sees something...
                         
                          GORDO
           Ten O'clock. Thirty yards. Squirt those
           guys.
                         
          Norman fires off a long burst. The last of the belt. He
          cracks open another box and reloads.

           I think you're right. How long can we

           Not long.
                         
          Wardaddy HEARS hobnail boots on top of the tank - He pulls
          his .45 And opens his hatch.
                         
          An SS TROOPER is right there! -- He kicks Wardaddy's gun
          hand, the .45 Drops to the turret basket floor. Wardaddy
          reaches up and grabs the Trooper's legs, pulls him down into
          the tank. Wardaddy pulls his knife...
                         
          The German soldier headbutts Wardaddy with his helmet
          splitting his nose. Wardaddy is not thwarted. He stabs the
          man in the chest. Bible freaking out.

           Gimme a hand.
                         
          Wardaddy and Bible hoist the dying German and shove him out
          of the tank through Wardaddy's hatch.
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           They're getting cocky.
                         
          Wardaddy is in pain. Blood soaking his sleeve.

           So patch me up. Gordo, get up here and
           work the thirty.
                         
          Gordo slips into the turret. Reloads the .30 Cal and starts
          shooting targets.
                         
          ON NORMAN - Still shooting. Empty brass is up to his ankles.
                         
          Bible cuts open Wardaddy's sleeve. Pours sulfa powder on the

          Bible replaces Gordo at the gunner's position. Wardaddy is

          Bible opens the Gunner's hatch and joins Wardaddy with his

          He jumps down from the tank and grabs a German assault rifle.

          Several German smoke grenades are tossed at the Fury. They

           Your mother's in here. She can't talk
           now. Her mouth's full.
                         
                          SS VOICE
                          (GERMAN)
           I'll cut off your fingertips and make you
           eat the,!
                         
                          WARDADDY
                          (GERMAN)
           Shut up and send me more pigs to kill!
                         
          Suddenly dozens of German weapons open up simultaneously.
                         
          It is an unbelievable volume of fire. Wardaddy fires back
          blindly into the smoke...
                         
          RAT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT! - He runs out of ammo...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Bible! Ammo!
                         
          Bible drops into the turret and grabs a box of ammo off the
          rack. He climbs up and hands it to Wardaddy.
                         
          THWACK! - Bible is hit in the head and instantly killed. He
          clatters back into the tank. Now it's just Norman and
          Wardaddy.
                         
          ON NORMAN - Helplessly cowering for his life as bullets
          ricochet all around him...
                         
          THWACK-THWACK! - Wardaddy is hit twice...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Button up!
                         
          Wardaddy drops inside the tank and closes the hatch. Norman
          closes his hatch.
                         
          INT. CROSSROADS - FURY - NIGHT
                         
          The bullets striking the tank sound like gravel hitting sheet
          metal. Wardaddy holds Bible. He has a massive head wound.
          Wardaddy is devastated. He gently wipes the blood from
          Bible's face.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I'm sorry, Boyd. I did my best.

          Norman watching this - The SS Troopers are going to finish
          them off at any moment. Norman SEES Wardaddy is bleeding
          heavily from his gunshot wounds...
                         
                          NORMAN
           You're wounded.
                         
          Wardaddy notices his two new bullet holes for the first time.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Sure am.
                         
                          NORMAN
           Sergeant Collier?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           My name's Don.
                         
                          NORMAN
           Sorry. Don?
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Yeah kid?
                         
                          NORMAN
           I'm scared.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           I'm scared too.
                         
          Wardaddy lights a cigarette. Finds his bottle of Cognac and
          takes a belt. Offers Norman the bottle, it's covered with
          blood. Norman wipes the bottle. He takes a sip.
                         
          Wardaddy is fading fast. Norman will soon be alone...
                         
                          NORMAN
           I want to surrender.
                         
                          WARDADDY
           Please don't. They'll hurt you real bad.
           And kill you real bad.
                         
          Wardaddy takes a drag on his cigarette. The hatch above him
          is opening. With casual ease, Wardaddy pulls his .45 - Aims
          up at the hatch.
                         
          BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! - He empties the pistol and
          the hatch drops shut. He ejects the mag. Moving slow from
          blood loss. The gun slick in his hands. He pats his pockets
          looking for a fresh mag...
                         
          The hatch opens - THREE GRENADES ARE DROPPED INSIDE!

          Smoking, HISSING, deadly. Wardaddy looks at Norman who is
          frozen with fear...
                         
                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)
           Go.
                         
          Norman snaps into action. He dives into the driver's seat,
          pushing Gordo's body aside - He opens the EMERGENCY ESCAPE
          HATCH and dives through...
                         
          EXT. CROSSROADS - UNDERNEATH THE FURY - NIGHT
                         
          Norman is under the tank. Without a weapon!
                         
          BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! - The grenades explode inside the tank. With
          that Norman knows Wardaddy is no more. Norman is all alone.
          Around him he hears angry cursing GERMAN VOICES...
                         
          Norman crawls into the crater made by the land mine that
          broke the track. He makes himself as small as possible, pulls
          dirt in over himself. Burying himself...
                         
          EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT
                         
          SS Troopers everywhere. Their medics attend to their wounded.
          They swarm over the Fury. Open her hatches. Aim their weapons
          inside and...
                         
          BRDDDT-BRDDDDT! - Make sure all the occupants are dead.
                         
          EXT. CROSSROADS - UNDERNEATH THE FURY - NIGHT
                         
          A YOUNG TROOPER looks beneath the tank with a flashlight.
          Norman, nearly entirely buried, follows the path of the light
          beam with his one exposed eye...
                         
          The light plays across the undercarriage. Norman's HEARTBEAT
          feels excruciating loud. Blood pounding in his ears. AN SS
          OFFICER SHOUTS...
                         
                          SS OFFICER
                          (GERMAN)
           Let's go! We're behind schedule! Move it!
           Hurry up! Let's move!
                         
          The Young Trooper turns off the lights. He stands and walks
          away. Iron boot heels crunching the road...
                         
          Norman thanks his higher power. He may just survive this
          thing. Then the boots stop. And return...
                         
          Norman tries to be one with the roadbed.

          The Trooper lays down - CLICK - Shines the light directly in
          Norman's face. He's been discovered.
                         
          ON THE YOUNG TROOPER - Now we see his face. He's a kid,
          younger than Norman. A boy in uniform. He looks Norman in the
          eye.
                         
          Norman slowly lifts his hands in surrender. His oil and blood
          soaked fingers emerging from the dirt and dust.
                         
          The Young Trooper smiles weakly - "I won't hurt you." Then
          turns off the light and walks away.
                         
          Norman sags with anxious relief.
                         
          Shrill WHISTLES. SHOUTING as the Sergeants get their squads
          on the march again. Jackboots CRUNCH the road as the SS
          formation continues down the road.
                         
          EXT. CROSSROADS - UNDERNEATH THE FURY - NIGHT
                         
          The SS Troops are marching away in the distance. On a
          pointless and doomed mission against overwhelming Allied
          Armies steamrolling across Germany.
                         
          Now it's quiet. Dead quiet. Norman, buried in his hole,
          finally succumbs to exhaustion. His eyes close. He passes out
          curled in his womb of dirt.
                         
          INT. CROSSROADS - FURY - DAWN
                         
          Distant ROOSTERS CROW. The escape hatch slowly opens. It's
          Norman - He slips inside the Fury. He forces his way past
          Gordo's body. Then covers Gordo with a jacket. He moves to
          Coon-Ass and covers him. Then Bible, he gently crosses his
          arms over his chest.
                         
          There's Wardaddy. Sitting there. The grenades have made a
          mess of him. Norman takes off his jacket and covers him up.
          He pauses. Gently picks up Wardaddy's big calloused hang. He
          looks at his palm. Traces the lines a moment. As if to
          confirm something he already knew. Then he sets it down.
                         
          Norman finds Wardaddy's knife on the floor of the turret
          basket. He picks up the knife and runs his thumb along all
          the notches. Norman HEARS something...
                         
          Movement outside the tank. And VOICES!
                         
          He freezes. Unsure what to do. This kid is traumatized, he's
          in no condition to fight Nazis...
                         
          Alone and scared. Norman sits there trembling, holding
          Wardaddy's knife for protection...

          An American soldier. - One we recognize - The Huge Dirty
          Soldier from Baker Company - He looks at Norman with war
          weary eyes. Wipes his nose on his sleeve and shouts to his
          buddies.
                         
           HUGE DIRTY SOLDIER

          The Fury is shot to hell, burnt and scarred. Baker Company
          soldiers are gathered around her.
                         
          Norman is pulled out of the hatch and laid onto a stretcher.
          Two MEDICS carry Norman to a waiting Half-Track.
                         
                          MEDIC
           You're a hero. You know that?
                         
          Norman doesn't know what that means. Or really care. It is
          clear from the churning angst in his eyes he will never, ever
          be the same.
                         
          CRANE UP - Until we look straight down on the crossroads and
          see the true scope of the fight, of the carnage...
                         
          Laid out in a ring around the tank for fifty yards are a
          couple hundred dead SS Troopers...
                         
          Norman is loaded into the Half-Track. It slowly drives away.
